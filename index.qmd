# Preface & Course Overview {.unnumbered}

This notebook was created to host learning materials for Math 130: Introduction to R at California State University, Chico.

Some of this material presented is a derivation from work that is Copyright © Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/) which is under a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which allows for adaptations and reuse of the work.

Math 130 is designed as a short-course "primer" to be taken before, or concurrently with, an upper division or graduate level Statistics course such as Math 315 or Math 615.

The goal of Math 130 is to get the complete novice up and running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible research and literate programming for data analysis. We recognize there are many topics and many approaches to teach an introduction to the R programming language. We have picked specific topics and methods that we believe learners will need to succeed in subsequent classes.

## How this book is organized

## Tool choices

### R + R Studio = Success

-   The term **R** refers to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.

-   **RStudio** is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software.

-   We will be programming in the R language, using the R Studio platform. You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in section `FIXME`

### Why use R?

-   Open source, cross-platform, and free
-   Great for reproducibility
-   Flexible and extensible. Doesn't do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.
-   Tons of learning resources
-   Currently R is used in all of Chico's upper division Statistics & Data Science courses, as well as in some Science, Public Health, Economics, Finance, and some graduate courses.
-   Does not involve lots of pointing and clicking (that's a good thing!)
-   Works on data of all shapes and sizes
-   Produces high-quality graphics
-   Large and welcoming community

### Why use R Studio?

-   Customizable workspace that docks all windows together.
-   Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)
-   Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.
-   Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.
-   Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.
-   Free training videos available from the developers directly.
-   One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations, presentations (like this one!), websites.

## Programming is scary!

Learning to program has other benefits

-   Improves your logical skills and critical problem solving
-   Increases your attention to detail
-   Increases your self reliance and empowers you to control your own research.
-   Your PI will love your awesome graphics and reports.
-   Some people think what you do is magic.
-   Thinking graduate school? [\[expect to learn this on your own\]](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)

### Why no point and click?

Because it's not reproducible.

-   Which boxes did you click last time?
-   New data? Gotta do it all over.
-   Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over.
-   Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...

## Callout boxes and icons

::: callout-note
### blue boxes

mean this is a note
:::

::: callout-danger
### orange boxes

means danger. so this is red?
:::

::: callout-caution
### yellow boxes

means caution
:::

::: callout-tip
### green box

is a tip or an example
:::

::: callout-danger
### danger box

this is a red box used to show warnings or critical notes
:::

::: callout-important
### this is important

important is red box
:::

not sure what color :::
