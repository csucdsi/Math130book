We recognize there are many topics and many approaches to teach an introduction to the R programming language. We have picked specific topics and methods that we believe learners will need to succeed in subsequent classes.",

For best results you should be trying to understand this new language, and how to tell R to do what you want it to do.\nThe tendency may be to reach out to AI to help write code for you, but this does not help you learn and worse can provide code that is overly complicated and does not work as intended.",

    "text": "1.5 Packages\n“Where the real money from the movie is made.”\nR is considered an Open Source software program. That means many (thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by writing commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis easier, or to make a graphic prettier.\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will use. However these other user-written packages add so much good stuff that it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality that makes R so powerful of a language.\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like boxplot() and hist() that exist in base R. But we will quickly move on to creating graphics using functions contained in the ggplot2 package. We will be managing data using functions in dplyr and reading in Excel files using readxl. Installing packages will become your favorite past-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Install ggplot2\n\n\n\nTyping the following in the console to install the ggplot2 package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message similar to:\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR is Case sensitive\n\n\n\nR is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error message like the following.\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)\nThe correct package name is ggplot2, not ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Method of installing Packages\n\n\n\nAdditional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab.\n\nOn the packages tab, click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the name of the package you want in the text box.\nAt the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to ‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.\n\n\n\nInstall all the things!\n\nNow that you’re a package installing pro, go ahead and install the following packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Your Turn\n\n\n\nInstall the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it to finish before entering the next command. Some of these contain functions that we will use, others contain data sets that we will be working with.\n\n\n\ntidyverse\n\nsjPlot\ngtsummary\nggpubr\ntinytex\n\n\n\nhere\nopenintro\n\npalmerpenguins\nnycflights13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust but Verify\n\n\n\nCheck to see if you have a package installed by looking in the packages tab. You can also type the command installed.packages() into the console and examine the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note about the tidyverse.\n\n\n\n“The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.”\nWe will specifically be using the dplyr, ggplot2 and readxl packages that are part of, and thus installed with, the tidyverse. In these lessons we will load the specific package that we need (e.g. only dplyr or only ggplot2), but loading the tidyverse has the same effect of readying the necessary functions as loading each individual package.

If you have heard of R Markdown - Quarto is the “next generation” of R Markdown.\nWhile Quarto is also it’s own standalone program, it comes “built-in” to R Studio so no additional installations needed!\nQuarto is an example of literate programming where the explanation of the program (or analysis) logic is presented in a natural language (such as English), with supporting pieces of code embedded in the document itself. Quarto combines normal text such as this sentence, code and the output from the code all in one file.

Chunks close (end) with another three back ticks. a back tick is the key to the left of the 1 on your keyboardNote the background color of this section has changed to a different shade. This helps you identify you have closed your code chunk properly.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n2+2\n```\n\n\nYou can insert code chunks by using the button in the top right of an RMD file (Insert -&gt; R), or by typing CTRL+ALT+I.\nR code chunks can also have a YAML style header, identified by #| at the beginning of the line. In this case I set eval to false to prevent the code inside this code chunk from being run when I render the whole document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly code goes in code chunks\n\n\n\nThat’s why they’re called code chunks. No normal text.

    "text": "3.2 Creating objects in R (Video)\nThis lesson is designed to explain the basics of how R works as a programming language.\nUh oh, we got an Error. Nothing to worry about, errors happen all the time.\n&gt; R is waiting on you…\nNotice the console shows a + prompt. This means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command.\nThis is because you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.\nWhen this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press Esc; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the &gt; prompt.\nLet’s go back to that long expression from lesson 2 (corrected), but this time type it into a new code chunk. Recall we can make a new code chunk by pressing CTRL+ALT+I, or by clicking on Insert then R. Also recall that we submit this code by pressing Ctrl+Enter or clicking the green play arrow in the top right corner of the code chunk.\nMake a change to the above expression and run the command again.\nFor the rest of this lesson, retype each code chunk below into the notes file you just created. Be sure to annotate these notes as you would take notes in any other class. For you to retain what you are reading and learning, writing out what these pieces of code are doing (e.g. the assignment operator &lt;-) in your own words is an effective learning technique.\nTo do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to objects. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator &lt;-, and the value we want to give it:\nweight_kg &lt;- 55\n&lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing x &lt;- 3, the value of x is 3.\nObjects can be given any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. However there are some naming guidelines you need to be aware of.\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\nweight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\nNow that R has weight_kg in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\nWe can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\nThis means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new object, weight_lb:\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\nR executes code in top-down order. So what happens on line 10 occurs before line 11. What do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\nComments. The comment character in R is #, anything to the right of a # in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes, and explanations in your scripts as demonstrated earlier.",

    "text": "3.3 Functions and their arguments (Video)\nFunctions are “canned scripts” that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R packages (lesson 02).\nA function usually takes one or more inputs called arguments, and often (but not always) return a value.\nA typical example would be the function sqrt(). The input is the number 4, and the return value (the output) is the square root of 4, namely 2. Executing a function (‘running it’) is called calling the function.\n\nsqrt(4)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nLet’s look into the round function.\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can learn more about this function by typing ?round. The Usage section of the help documentation shows you what the default values for each argument are. This is a very important piece to pay attention. Sometimes the default behaviors are not what you want to happen.\n\nround(x, digits=0)\n\nIn the Arguments section the help file defines what each argument does.\n\nx is the object that you want to round. It must be a numeric vector.\ndigits is an integer indicating the number of decimal places to round to.\n\nAbove, we called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it has returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type digits = 2 or however many we want.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIf you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don’t have to name them:\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAnd if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nThis is a simple function with only one argument. Functions are the backbone of how R does it’s thing. You will get lots of practice with functions, and quickly encounter functions that require many arguments.",

Factor variables in R are special types of categorical variables. We will learn how to work with factor variables in week 2.\n\n\n3.4.3 Boolean\nWhen the value of an object can only be TRUE or FALSE it is called a Boolean variable. These are created by writing a logical statement where the answer is either TRUE or FALSE. Silly examples include “Is 3 greater than 4?” and “Is the square root of 4 equal to 2?”\n\n3&gt;4\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsqrt(4)==2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nWe will see how to use these logical statements to do things such as subsetting data and creating new variables.",

    "section": "3.5 Data Structures (Video)",
    "text": "3.5 Data Structures (Video)\nData structures is how we refer to a collection of pieces of data, like a series of numbers, or a list of words.\n\n3.5.1 Vectors\nA vector is the most common and basic data structure in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R.\nWe can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\n(weight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82))\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\n(animals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\"))\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nAn important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. That is, each element in the vector has to be the same type. You can use the function class() to see what data type a vector is.\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIf you try to mix and match data types within a vector, some “coercion” will occur. If you combine letters and numbers, everything will be treated as letters.\n\n(mix_match &lt;- c(weight_g, animals))\n\n[1] \"50\"    \"60\"    \"65\"    \"82\"    \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\nclass(mix_match)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThis is VERY important to keep in mind when you import data into R from another program like Excel. If you have any letters (like the word “missing”, or “NA”) in a column, all data from that column will be treated as character strings. And you can’t do math (such as take a mean) on words.\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array). We will only talk about vectors,data.frames and factors in this class (not all in this lesson).\n\n\n3.5.2 Doing math on vectors\nYou can perform math operations on the elements of a vector such as\n\nweight_KG &lt;- weight_g/1000\nweight_KG\n\n[1] 0.050 0.060 0.065 0.082\n\n\nWhen adding two vectors together, the elements in the same position are added to each other. So element 1 in the vector a is added to element 1 in vector b.\n\na &lt;- c(1,2,3)\nb &lt;- c(6,7,8)\na+b\n\n[1]  7  9 11\n\n\nMore complex calculations can be performed on multiple vectors.\n\nwt_lb &lt;- c(155, 135, 90)\nht_in &lt;- c(72, 64, 50)\nbmi &lt;- 703*wt_lb / ht_in^2\nbmi\n\n[1] 21.01948 23.17017 25.30800\n\n\nAll these operations on vectors behave the same way when dealing with variables in a data set (data.frame).\nIf you want to add the values within a vector, you use functions such as sum(), max() and mean()\n\nsum(a)\n\n[1] 6\n\nmax(b)\n\n[1] 8\n\nmean(a+b)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Subsetting vectors\nIf we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[2]\n\n[1] \"rat\"\n\nanimals[c(2, 3)]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\nThe number in the indices indicates which element to extract. For example we can extract the 3rd element in weight_g by typing\n\nweight_g[3]\n\n[1] 65\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Conditional subsetting\nAnother common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. TRUE will select the element with the same index, while FALSE will not. Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests such as:\n\nweight_g &gt; 50  # returns TRUE or FALSE depending on which elements that meet the condition\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can use this output to select elements in a different vector where the value of that logical statement is TRUE. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values where weight in grams is above 50 we would type:\n\nweight_g[weight_g &gt; 50]\n\n[1] 60 65 82\n\n\nYou can combine multiple tests using & (both conditions are true, AND) or | (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):\nWeight is less than 30g or greater than 60g\n\nweight_g[weight_g &lt; 30 | weight_g &gt; 60]\n\n[1] 65 82\n\n\nWeight is between 60 and 80lbs\n\nweight_g[weight_g &gt;= 60 & weight_g &lt;= 80]\n\n[1] 60 65\n\n\nHere, &lt; stands for “less than”, &gt; for “greater than”, &gt;= for “greater than or equal to”, and == for “equal to”. The double equal sign == is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single = sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to &lt;-).\nA common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could use the “or” operator | to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious. The function %in% allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[animals == \"cat\" | animals == \"rat\"] # returns both rat and cat\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"cat\"\n\nanimals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\")\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nanimals[animals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\")]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"dog\" \"cat\"\n\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Order matters.\nWhen considering string or character vectors or data elements, R treats everything in alphabetical order. Thus\n\n\"four\" &gt; \"five\"\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis will come back to bug you when dealing with categorical data types called factors in a later lesson. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how to be the boss of your factors and not let R tell you that “one” is greater than “four”.",

    "text": "3.6 Data Frames (Video)\nData frames are like spreadsheet data, rectangular with rows and columns. Ideally each row represents data on a single observation and each column contains data on a single variable, or characteristic, of the observation. This is called tidy data. This is an important concept that you are encouraged to read more about if you will be doing your own data collection and research. This article is a good place to start.\nA data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector.\n\n\n\nfigure depicting a data frame\n\n\nFor this part of the lesson we will use a data set called diamonds that comes with the ggplot2 package that you installed as part of lesson 02.

We can load the diamonds data set into our global environment by typing\n\ndiamonds &lt;- ggplot2::diamonds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at your data often\n\n\n\nTo see the raw data values, click on the square spreadsheet icon to the right of the data set name in the top right panel of RStudio (circled in green in the image below).\n\n\n\n\n\nscreenshot of dataset in the global environment\n\n\nThis area also tells us a little bit about the data set, specifically that it has 53,940 rows and 10 variables.\nWhen data sets are very large such as this one, it may be difficult to see all columns or all rows.

Let’s try them out!\n\nSize:\n\ndim(diamonds) - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object)\nnrow(diamonds) - returns the number of rows\nncol(diamonds) - returns the number of columns\n\nContent:\n\nhead(diamonds) - shows the first 6 rows\ntail(diamonds) - shows the last 6 rows\n\nNames:\n\nnames(diamonds) - returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects)\nrownames(diamonds) - returns the row names\n\nSummary:\n\nstr(diamonds) - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column\nsummary(diamonds) - summary statistics for each column\n\n\nNote: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides a data.frame\n\n\n3.6.2 Identifying variables\nData frames can be subset by specifying indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:\ndiamonds[, \"depth\"]\ndiamonds[, 5] \ndiamonds$depth\nThe $ notation has the format data$variable and so can be thought of as specifying which data set the variable is in. It is easy to imagine a situation where two different data sets have the same name.\nThis allows us to perform calculations on an individual variable. Below is an example of finding the average price for all diamonds in the data set.\n\nmean(diamonds$price)\n\n[1] 3932.8\n\n\nYou can also subset a variable based on the value of a secondary variable. Here is an example of finding the average price for Good quality diamonds.\n\nmean(diamonds$price[diamonds$cut==\"Good\"])\n\n[1] 3928.864\n\n\nNote that the $ is used in both locations where we want to identify a variable.",

    "text": "4.2 Missing Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing data section video\n\n\n\nSometimes the value for a variable is missing. Think of it as a blank cell in an spreadsheet. Missing data can be a result of many things: skip patterns in a survey (i.e. non-smokers don’t get asked how many packs per week they smoke), errors in data reads from a machine, researchers skipped a day of data collection for one plant on accident etc.\nR puts a NA as a placeholder when the value for that piece of data is missing. We can see 4 out of the first 6 values for the variable fage (fathers age) in the ncbirths data set are missing.\n\nhead(ncbirths$fage)\n\n[1] NA NA 19 21 NA NA\n\n\nProblem 1: R can’t do arithmetic on missing data.\nSo 5 + NA = NA, and if you were to try to calculate the mean() of a variable, you’d also get NA.\n\nmean(ncbirths$fage)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Fix this error\n\n\n\nAdd the argument na.rm=TRUE to the mean() function inside the right hand parenthesis to calculate the mean after excluding missing values.\nRun this code chunk interactively to ensure that it works before continuing.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nmean(ncbirths$fage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 30.25573\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2: Some plots will show NA as it’s own category\nSometimes this is fine, other times this is undesirable. We’ll see later how we can adjust this plot to remove that column of NA.\n\nggplot(ncbirths, aes(premie)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing values can cause some problems during analysis or undesirable features in a plot so let’s see how to detect missing values and how to work around them.\n\n4.2.1 Identifying missing values\nTo find out how many values in a particular variable are missing we can use several different approaches.\n\nLook at the raw data\nWe can look at the raw data using head() or opening the data set in the spreadsheet view and skim with our eyes for NA values. This may not be helpful if there is no missing values in the first 6 rows, or if there is a large number of variables to look through.\n\nhead(ncbirths)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n   fage  mage mature    weeks premie visits marital gained weight lowbirthweight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         \n1    NA    13 younger …    39 full …     10 not ma…     38   7.63 not low       \n2    NA    14 younger …    42 full …     15 not ma…     20   7.88 not low       \n3    19    15 younger …    37 full …     11 not ma…     38   6.63 not low       \n4    21    15 younger …    41 full …      6 not ma…     34   8    not low       \n5    NA    15 younger …    39 full …      9 not ma…     27   6.38 not low       \n6    NA    15 younger …    38 full …     19 not ma…     22   5.38 low           \n# ℹ 3 more variables: gender &lt;fct&gt;, habit &lt;fct&gt;, whitemom &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\n\n\nLook at data summaries\nFunctions such as table() have a useNA=\"always\" option to show how many records have missing values, and summary() will always show a column for NA.\n\ntable(ncbirths$habit, useNA=\"always\")\n\n\nnonsmoker    smoker      &lt;NA&gt; \n      873       126         1 \n\nsummary(ncbirths$fage)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Calling the function is.na() on the vector x, results in three values, where only the second one is TRUE – meaning the second element is missing.\nThis can be extended to do things such as using the sum() function to count the number of missing values in a variable. Here we are nesting the functions is.na() is written entirely inside the sum() function.\n\nsum(is.na(ncbirths$fage))\n\n[1] 171\n\n\nThere are 171 records in this data set where the age for the father is not present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegating is.na() to find the non-missing values\n\n\n\nSometimes you want to operate only only the non-missing values.

Wrap !is.na() around the premie variable in the ggplot code to create a barchart that does not have a bar for missing values.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nggplot(ncbirths, aes(!is.na(premie))) + geom_bar()",

You will learn several ways to do this throughout this course, but we will start by using base R functions and methods. These are methods that use functions that come with R, not from additional packages.\n\n4.3.1 Overwrite existing values\nChoose all observations (rows) of a data set, where a variable is equal to some value, then set assign &lt;- a new_value to those rows.\n\ndata[data$variable==value] &lt;- new_value  # example code to show syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Too low birthweight\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the numerical distribution of birthweight (in pounds) of the baby.\n\nsummary(ncbirths$weight)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The researchers you are working with decide that is a mistake and should be excluded from the data. We would then set all records where weight=1 to missing.\n\nncbirths$weight[ncbirths$weight==1] &lt;- NA\n\nCode explainer:\n\nThe specific variable ncbirths$weight is on the left side outside the []. So just the variable weight is being changed.\nRecall that bracket notation [] can be used to select rows where a certain logical statement is true. So [ncbirths$weight==1] will only show records where weight is equal to 1.\nNotice where the assignment arrow (&lt;-) is at. This code assigns the value of NA (missing) to the variable weight, where weight==1.\n\n\nmin(ncbirths$weight, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.19\n\n\nThe minimum weight is now 1.19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Your Turn\n\n\n\nBut what about other weights that aren’t quite as low as 1, but still unusually low?\n\nWrite the code to set all birth weights less than 4 lbs (&lt;4) to missing (NA).\nThen recalculate the mean to confirm your recode worked.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nncbirths$weight[ncbirths$weight &lt; 4] &lt;- NA\nmin(ncbirths$weight, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Creating new variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating new variables section video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew variables should be added to the data frame\n\n\n\nThis can be done in base R using $ sign notation.\n\n\nThe new variable you want to create goes on the left side of the assignment operator &lt;-, and how you want to create that new variable goes on the right side.\n\ndata$new_variable &lt;- creation_statement  # example code not run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Row-wise difference between two existing variables\n\n\n\nAs a pregnancy progresses, both the mother and the baby gain weight. The variable gained is the total amount of weight the mother gained in her pregnancy. The variable weight is how much the baby weighed at birth.\n\n\nThe following code creates a new variable wtgain_mom the weight gained by the mother, that is not due to the baby by subtracting weight from gained. Note all variables are prefaced with $, denoting that they exist inside the ncbirths data set.\n\nncbirths$wtgain_mom &lt;- ncbirths$gained - ncbirths$weight\n\nTo confirm this variable was created correctly, we look at the data contained in three variables in question.\n\nhead(ncbirths[,c('gained', 'weight', 'wtgain_mom')])\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  gained weight wtgain_mom\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     38   7.63       30.4\n2     20   7.88       12.1\n3     38   6.63       31.4\n4     34   8          26  \n5     27   6.38       20.6\n6     22   5.38       16.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust but Verify\n\n\n\nIt’s always important to visually confirm that the code you wrote actually had the intended effect.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Dichtomizing data\nThe ifelse() is hands down the easiest way to create a binary variable (dichotomizing, only 2 levels)\nLet’s add a variable to identify if a mother in the North Carolina births data set was underage at the time of birth. Specifically Make a new variable underage on the ncbirths data set. If mage is under 18, then the value of this new variable is underage, else it is labeled as adult.\n\nncbirths$underage &lt;- ifelse(ncbirths$mage &lt; 18, \"underage\", \"adult\")\n\nCode explainer:\n\nThe function is ifelse() - one word.\nThe arguments are: ifelse(logical, value if TRUE, value if FALSE)\n\nThe logical argument is a statement that resolves as a boolean variable, as either TRUE or FALSE.\nThe second argument is what you want the resulting variable to contain if the logical argument is TRUE.\nThe last argument is what you want the resulting variable to contain if the logical argument is FALSE.\n\n\nTrust but Verify\nFirst let’s look at the frequency table of underage and see if records exist with the new categories, and if there are any missing values.\n\ntable(ncbirths$underage, useNA=\"always\")\n\n\n   adult underage     &lt;NA&gt; \n     963       37        0 \n\n\nNext let’s check it against the value of mage itself. Let’s look at all rows where mothers age is either 17 or 18 mage %in% c(17,18), and only the columns of interest.\n\nncbirths[ncbirths$mage %in% c(17,18),c('mage', 'underage')]\n\n# A tibble: 57 × 2\n    mage underage\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1    17 underage\n 2    17 underage\n 3    17 underage\n 4    17 underage\n 5    17 underage\n 6    17 underage\n 7    17 underage\n 8    17 underage\n 9    17 underage\n10    17 underage\n# ℹ 47 more rows\n\n\nNotice I snuck a new operator in on you - %in%. This is a way you can provide a list of values (a.k.a a vector) and say “if the value of the variable I want is %in% any of these options in this vector…” do the thing.",

Some examples in this lesson will show how to perform a certain task using base R functions, as well as functions from the forcats package.\nThe term factor refers to a data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable corresponds to a limited number of categories, while a continuous variable can correspond to an infinite number of values.\nAn example of a categorical variable is the number variable in the email data set. This variable contains data on whether there was no number, a small number (under 1 million), or a big number in the content of the email.",

These codes stand for categories, such as “no” and “yes”. Sometimes we want to analyze these binary variables in two ways:\n\nFor statistical analyses, the data must be numeric 0/1.\nFor many graphics, the data must be a factor, “no/yes”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: What type of transmission does that car have?\n\n\n\nThe am variable from the mtcars data set records whether or not the car has an automatic transmission, or a manual one. However, the values were recorded as 0 for automatic and 1 for manual.\n\n\n\ntable(mtcars$am) # view which values are present\n\n\n 0  1 \n19 13 \n\nclass(mtcars$am) # confirm what R thinks the data type is\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nR thinks this variable is numeric, but we know that’s not the case. We can use the function factor() to convert the numeric variable am to a factor, applying labels to convert 0 to “automatic” and 1 to “manual”.\n\nmtcars$transmission_type &lt;- factor(mtcars$am, \n                                   labels=c(\"automatic\", \"manual\"))\n\nThe ordering of the labels argument must be in the same order (left to right) as the factor levels themselves. Look back at the order of columns in the table - it goes 0 then 1. Thus our labels need to go “automatic” then “manual”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust but verify\n\n\n\nWe can confirm that the new variable was created correctly by creating a two-way contingency table by calling the table(old variable, new variable) function on both the old and new variables.\n\n\n\ntable(mtcars$am, mtcars$transmission_type, useNA=\"always\")\n\n      \n       automatic manual &lt;NA&gt;\n  0           19      0    0\n  1            0     13    0\n  &lt;NA&gt;         0      0    0\n\n\nHere we see that all the 0’s were recoded to automatic, and all the 1’s recoded to manual, and there are no new missing values.

This is unlike the barchart that has a categorical x-axis, and vertical bars that are separated.\n\nggplot2ggpubr\n\n\nUsing the ggplot2 package we can create a histogram by adding the layer geom_histogram().\n\nggplot(pen, aes(x=body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to ggplot2’s common starter code and different geometries, the ggpubr package uses specific functions for each type of plot. The gghistogram package makes a histogram very similar to the ggplot2 default, but with a different theme applied (different appearance). Otherwise it’s the same.\n\ngghistogram(pen, x=\"body_mass_g\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables names in quotes\n\n\n\nThis is a feature of ggpubr functions - variable names are always in quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Density curves\nTo get a better idea of the true shape of the distribution we can “smooth” out the bins and create what’s called a density plot or curve. Notice that the shape of this distribution curve is much… “wigglier” than the histogram may have implied.\n\nggplot2ggpubr\n\n\nWith ggplot2 we use the geom_density() geometry to produce a nicer looking density plot with minimal additional code.\n\nggplot(pen, aes(x=body_mass_g)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the ggdensity function from the ggpubr package creates a very similar density plot with a different default theme.\n\nggdensity(pen, x=\"body_mass_g\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Boxplots\nAnother very common way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is using a boxplot. Boxplots are useful for quickly identifying where the bulk of your data lie. R specifically draws a “modified” boxplot where values that are considered outliers are plotted as dots.\n\nggplot2ggpubr\n\n\nWith ggplot you can create either a horizontal or vertical boxplot by specifying your numeric variable to be on either x or y . Notice the middle of the box is centered on 0, this is just a placeholder.

For example, we can select all flights on January 1st with\n\nfilter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)\n\n# A tibble: 842 × 19\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819\n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830\n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850\n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022\n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837\n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728\n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854\n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723\n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846\n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745\n# ℹ 832 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;,\n#   tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;\n\n\nfilter() works similarly to subset() except that you can give it any number of filtering conditions which are joined together with &.

In dplyr, you use the group_by() function to describe how to break a dataset down into groups of rows. You can then use the resulting object in exactly the same functions as above; they’ll automatically work “by group” when the input is a grouped.\nLet’s demonstrate how some of these functions work after grouping the flights data set by month. First we’ll create a new data set that is grouped by month.\n\nby_month &lt;- group_by(flights, month)\n\nThe summarise() verb allows you to calculate summary statistics for each group.

We show both here because you will see both used out in the wild and need to know they are interchangeable.\n\n\nConsider the following group of operations that take the data set flights, and produce a final data set (a4) that contains only the flights where the daily average delay is greater than a half hour.\n\na1 &lt;- group_by(flights, year, month, day)\na2 &lt;- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)\na3 &lt;- summarise(a2,\n                arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n                dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\na4 &lt;- filter(a3, arr &gt; 30 | dep &gt; 30)\nhead(a4)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n# Groups:   year, month [3]\n   year month   day   arr   dep\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2013     1    16  34.2  24.6\n2  2013     1    31  32.6  28.7\n3  2013     2    11  36.3  39.1\n4  2013     2    27  31.3  37.8\n5  2013     3     8  85.9  83.5\n6  2013     3    18  41.3  30.1\n\n\nIt does the trick, but what if you don’t want to save all the intermediate results (a1 - a3)?

This is difficult to read because the order of the operations is from inside to out, and the arguments are a long way away from the function. To get around this problem, dplyr provides the %&gt;% operator. x %&gt;% f(y) turns into f(x, y) so you can use it to rewrite multiple operations so you can read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:\n\n1flights %&gt;%\n2  group_by(year, month, day) %&gt;%\n3  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %&gt;%\n4  summarise(\n    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), \n    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n5  filter(arr &gt; 30 | dep &gt; 30)\n\n\n1\n\nTake the flights data set and then,\n\n2\n\ngroup it by date and then,\n\n3\n\nselects the necessary variables, and then,\n\n4\n\ncalculate the mean arrival and departure delays, and then,\n\n5\n\nfilter to only keep rows with a daily average delay over half hour.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 49 × 5\n# Groups:   year, month [11]\n    year month   day   arr   dep\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2013     1    16  34.2  24.6\n 2  2013     1    31  32.6  28.7\n 3  2013     2    11  36.3  39.1\n 4  2013     2    27  31.3  37.8\n 5  2013     3     8  85.9  83.5\n 6  2013     3    18  41.3  30.1\n 7  2013     4    10  38.4  33.0\n 8  2013     4    12  36.0  34.8\n 9  2013     4    18  36.0  34.9\n10  2013     4    19  47.9  46.1\n# ℹ 39 more rows\n\n\nThe same 4 steps that resulted in the a4 data set, but without all the intermediate data saved! This can be very important when dealing with Big Data. R stores all data in memory, so if your little computer only has 2G of RAM and you’re working with a data set that is 500M in size, your computers memory will be used up fast. a1 takes 500M, a2 another 500M, by now your computer is getting slow. Make another copy at a3 and it gets worse, a4 now likely won’t even be able to be created because you’ll be out of memory.",

The delimiter is a character or symbol that separates columns of data from each other when stored in an external file. Recall back to the earlier lesson on data frames and matrices. Each column in the matrix represented data on a specific variable. Something had to tell R how to distinguish which values went with which variable.\nThere are two main types of delimiters we will consider in this class; comma and tab. That does not mean that data can’t be stored in other ways, these are just the two most common.\nEach delimiter type requires a different function or mechanism to import the data into R. If you use the wrong mechanism, the data may not be read in correctly if at all.",

    "section": "8.2 Paths (where the data lives)",
    "text": "8.2 Paths (where the data lives)\nIn addition to using the correct function for the delimiter type, we have to then tell the program explicitly where to find the files you want to access. To do that we need to find the file’s path. The path is a programmatic way to direct your computer to the location of a file.\nYou can think of it as a file’s address, or where it lives on your computer. But to get to that address depends on where you start your journey. For example to get to your instructors office in Holt Hall, it will be different depending on if you start from your house, vs start from Meriam Library. If someone else starts from their house, their path would look different than if you both started at the Library.\n\nAbsolute paths point to where a file is on a specific computer.\n\nExample: /Users/rdonatello/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Teaching/MATH 130/data This path to the data folder only exists on Dr. Donatello’s macbook.\n\nRelative paths indicate where inside the project folder a file is located.\n\nExample: MATH 130/data. This path to the data folder once you’re already in the MATH 130 folder. Anyone that has a MATH 130 folder with a data subfolder has the same path.\n\n\nWhen we use R Projects, we are setting the starting point (called the working directory) to your Math 130 folder. We will also reinforce that by using the here package. We want to specify that all our paths start \"here\", at the top of our project working directory. learn more about the here package\n\n\n\nCartoon showing two paths side-by-side. On the left is a scary spooky forest, with spiderwebs and gnarled trees, with file paths written on the branches like “~/mmm/nope.csv” and “setwd(“/haha/good/luck/”), with a scared looking cute fuzzy monster running out of it. On the right is a bright, colorful path with flowers, rainbow and sunshine, with signs saying “here!” and “it’s all right here!” A monster facing away from us in a backpack and walking stick is looking toward the right path. Stylized text reads “here: find your path.”\n\n\nLearn more about here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Whats your path?\n\n\n\nIn the console, type here::here() to have R show you what your current working directory is at. This is the absolute path to your Math 130 folder on your computer.\n\n# Dr. D's path to the code to build this course website\nhere::here()\n\n[1] \"/Users/rdonatello/GitHub/Math130book\"\n\n\n\n\nWorking with a combination of R projects and the here package this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without having to directly modify file paths in the individual scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCannot open the Connection\n\n\n\nThe import code in this lesson assumes that you are working in your R project, and that you have your data downloaded and in the data folder. If you get an error message saying Cannot open the connection - double check the following common places for mistakes:\n\nis the data file in the right place?\ndid you spell the name of the data set correctly?\nare you in your R project and using the here::here function correctly?",

If your computer asks, you can open it with the notepad program. Identify the following:\n\nwhat’s in the first row - data or variable names?\nwhat is the delimiter? - in this case it is a tab.\n\n\n\nWe will use the read.table() function that is in base R to read in any type of delimited file.\n\n1email &lt;- read.table(\n2          here::here(\"data/email.txt\"),\n3          header=TRUE,\n4          sep=\"\\t\"\n          )\n\n\n1\n\nUse the read.table() function because it is a text file\n\n2\n\nUse here::here to ensure you start at the project directory, then go into the data folder, and find the email.txt data set.\n\n3\n\nSet header=TRUE to signify that the data in the first row contains our column names\n\n4\n\nSpecify that the delimiter is a tab (\"\\t\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust but verify\n\n\n\nLet’s use the head function to look at the imported data, ensuring the variable names are intended, and that each column has data in it.\n\nhead(email)\n\n  spam to_multiple from cc sent_email                time image attach dollar\n1    0           0    1  0          0 2011-12-31 22:16:41     0      0      0\n2    0           0    1  0          0 2011-12-31 23:03:59     0      0      0\n3    0           0    1  0          0 2012-01-01 08:00:32     0      0      4\n4    0           0    1  0          0 2012-01-01 01:09:49     0      0      0\n5    0           0    1  0          0 2012-01-01 02:00:01     0      0      0\n6    0           0    1  0          0 2012-01-01 02:04:46     0      0      0\n  winner inherit viagra password num_char line_breaks format re_subj\n1     no       0      0        0   11.370         202      1       0\n2     no       0      0        0   10.504         202      1       0\n3     no       1      0        0    7.773         192      1       0\n4     no       0      0        0   13.256         255      1       0\n5     no       0      0        2    1.231          29      0       0\n6     no       0      0        2    1.091          25      0       0\n  exclaim_subj urgent_subj exclaim_mess number\n1            0           0            0    big\n2            0           0            1  small\n3            0           0            6  small\n4            0           0           48  small\n5            0           0            1   none\n6            0           0            1   none\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors!\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you forget to include the arguments for header or sep?

To accomplish this in ggplot is doable, but involves pre-calculating the percentages first and then plotting the summary numbers. This is a great place to introduce a different package: sjPlot.\nggplot2 is pretty great for easy out-of-the-box plots that don’t look half bad. Well for something a bit better when it comes to labeled barcharts let’s turn to the sjPlot package. Note this package uses ggplot graphics, but does not follow the syntax. So you’ll need to reference the vignette often to to learn more of what this package can do and what syntax it uses.\nTo plot the frequency distribution of a single categorical variable we use the “plot freq” function plot_frq\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\nplot_frq(email$number)\n\nTo plot the results of a contingency table we can use the plot_xtab function.\n\nplot_xtab(NCbirths$mature, NCbirths$marital)\n\nAs before, you MUST do a common sense check on the proportions that are shown, which also means knowing what the default settings for a function are. The defaults for plot_xtab show the proportion of the fill variable, within the variable that’s on the x. In context of the plot above, 17.5% of women who are not married are mature moms. 86.8% of all moms are younger moms.\nYou can see the available adjustments using function arguments by reviewing the vignette for that function. Here I will turn off the total column by adding show.total=FALSE and turn it into row percents by adding margin='row'.\n\nplot_xtab(NCbirths$mature, NCbirths$marital, margin='row', show.total = FALSE)\n\nNow 81.1% of mature moms are not married, and 41.6% of younger moms are married.

You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.\nTry to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant, but it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.\n⚠️ Don’t let not knowing exactly how to describe your problem prevent you from asking. Screenshots help tremendously!\nWhen asking someone for help try to 1. Explain what thing you are trying to do 2. Explain/show the code you wrote to try to do that thing 3. Explain/show your result, and if it’s not obvious explain why you feel it’s not the correct result. (E.g. you expected the answer to be 5, but instead it’s 10. )\n⚠️ Don’t spend more than 20 minutes banging your head on the wall before you ask for help!\n\n\nHelp from inside R Studio\n\nUse the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions\nOne of the fastest ways to get help is to use the RStudio help interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word mean, RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.\n\n\nI know the name of the function I want to use, but I’m not sure how to use it\nIf you need help with a specific function, let’s say barplot(), you can type:\n\n?barplot\n\nIf you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:\n\nargs(lm)\n\n\n\nI want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don’t know which one…\nIf you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the help.search() function, which is called by the double question mark ??. However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a match to your search request\n\n??kruskal\n\nIf you can’t find what you are looking for, you can use the rdocumentation.org website that searches through the help files across all packages available.\nFinally, a generic Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone else has already asked your question.\n\n\nI get an error message that I don’t understand\nStart by googling the error message. However, this doesn’t always work very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). If the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the function or package you’re using in your query.\nIf you check Stack Overflow, search using the [r] tag. Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in the search to find the answers: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r\n⚠️ Development of R moves pretty fast. When at all possible, use results from the past 1-2 years. Anything over 5 years old for packages such as ggplot, dplyr, and forcats are likely obsolete.\n\n\n\nIn Person help\n\nStart by ask the person sitting next to you! Don’t hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help.\nAsk in the Math & Statistics Discord server - we have a dedicated channel just for this class but a lot of students in the server know how to use R.\nAttend Community Coding.\n\nDrop in work session & dedicated space to work on coding projects.\nCollaborate with your peers and learn from experts.\nSome hours are held over Zoom\n\n\n\n\nOther Online\n\nIn RStudio go to Help –&gt; Cheatsheets or to this URL https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/\nStack Overflow: if your question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on how to ask a good question.\nChico R Users Google Group.\nThe Posit Community: it is read by a lot of people and is welcoming to new users.\nIf your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list for it. Usually it’s included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can be accessed using `packageDescription(“name-of-package:. You may also want to try to email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the code repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n\n\nUsing AI tools\n\nwrite guidance here\n\n\n\nWritten\nIf you’re a book kinda person, there is plenty of help available as well.

As often as every time you include a new R code chunk.\nSpell check your report prior to submission using RStudio.\nRe-read your report and edit for clarification and removing duplicated information.\nRemove superfluous code and output (i.e. printing a data set to the screen).\nThis is to be independent work. Papers that are too similar will receive no credit.\nLook at the grading rubric to help you decide the level of detail required.",

This information was summarized below the output in a paragraph form.\n\n\nBivariate Comparison: Describe the relationship between the two chosen variables.\nNo comparison was made, or the variables were compared, but inappropriate graphics or summary statistics were created.\nThe variables were compared using appropriate graphical methods and grouped summary statistics were created, but nothing was discussed.\nThe variables were compared using appropriate graphical methods and a short textual explanation of what the summaries showed.\n\n\nOrganization / Grammar: How well does the report read? How well organized is it? Was it checked for grammar and spelling mistakes?\nOnly R code, output is present. There is no discussion of results. Tons of extra R code that is not relevant to the discussion is present. Markdown headers were not used.\nAn attempt was made to discuss the results, but the explanations are not in a report format or there are some large grammar and/or spelling problems. Some R code that is not relevant to the analysis question at hand is being displayed. Markdown headers were used to create sections.\nThe report was spell written in well edited, full English sentences, and spell checked prior to submission. The report flowed well and followed the required order of discussion topics with markdown headers used successfully.",
