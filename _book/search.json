We recognize there are many topics and many approaches to teach an introduction to the R programming language. We have picked specific topics and methods that we believe learners will need to succeed in subsequent classes.",

    "text": "R + IDE = Success\n\nThe term R refers to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.\nAn IDE is an “Integrated Development Environment” and essentially is another program that lets you interact with R in a productive and efficient manner.\nRStudio has been a very popular IDE since around 2011 that has continued to flourish and improve throughtout the years.\nPositron is a new IDE created by the developers of RStudio that is based off another popular IDE called VSCode - and aimed primarily at Data Scientists\nThis book teaches you how to use R from within the R Studio IDE as we feel it is easier for new learners to start with. You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in section FIXME\n \nLeft photo credit; Right photo credit. Entire figure credit: Data Carpentry R for Social Scientists.\n\n\nWhy use R?\n\nOpen source, cross-platform, and free\nGreat for reproducibility\nFlexible and extensible. Doesn’t do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.\nTons of learning resources\nCurrently R is used in all of Chico’s upper division Statistics & Data Science courses, as well as in some Science, Public Health, Economics, Finance, and some graduate courses.\nDoes not involve lots of pointing and clicking (that’s a good thing!)\nWorks on data of all shapes and sizes\nProduces high-quality graphics\nLarge and welcoming community\n\n\n\nWhy use R Studio?\n\nCustomizable workspace that docks all windows together.\nNotebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)\nSyntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.\nCross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.\nTab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.\nFree training videos available from the developers directly.\nOne button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations, presentations (like this one!), websites.\n\nExamples of things you can do in RStudio",

That means many (thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by writing commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis easier, or to make a graphic prettier.\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will use. However these other user-written packages add so much good stuff that it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality that makes R so powerful of a language.\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like boxplot() and hist() that exist in base R. But we will quickly move on to creating graphics using functions contained in the ggplot2 package. We will be managing data using functions in dplyr and reading in Excel files using readxl. Installing packages will become your favorite past-time.\nInstalling Packages\n:pencil: Start by typing the following in the console to install the ggplot2 package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message simliar to:\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters.

You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.\nTry to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant, but it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.\n:warning: Don’t let not knowing exactly how to describe your problem prevent you from asking. Screenshots help tremendously!\nWhen asking someone for help try to 1. Explain what thing you are trying to do 2. Explain/show the code you wrote to try to do that thing 3. Explain/show your result, and if it’s not obvious explain why you feel it’s not the correct result. (E.g. you expected the answer to be 5, but instead it’s 10. )\n:warning: Don’t spend more than 20 minutes banging your head on the wall before you ask for help!\n\n\n2.0.2 Help from inside R Studio\n\n2.0.2.1 Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions\nOne of the fastest ways to get help is to use the RStudio help interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word mean, RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.\n\n\n2.0.2.2 I know the name of the function I want to use, but I’m not sure how to use it\nIf you need help with a specific function, let’s say barplot(), you can type:\n\n?barplot\n\nIf you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:\n\nargs(lm)\n\n\n\n2.0.2.3 I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don’t know which one…\nIf you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the help.search() function, which is called by the double question mark ??. However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a match to your search request\n\n??kruskal\n\nIf you can’t find what you are looking for, you can use the rdocumentation.org website that searches through the help files across all packages available.\nFinally, a generic Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone else has already asked your question.\n\n\n2.0.2.4 I get an error message that I don’t understand\nStart by googling the error message. However, this doesn’t always work very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). If the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the function or package you’re using in your query.\nIf you check Stack Overflow, search using the [r] tag. Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in the search to find the answers: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r\n:warning: Development of R moves pretty fast. When at all possible, use results from the past 1-2 years. Anything over 5 years old for packages such as ggplot, dplyr, and forcats are likely obsolete.\n\n\n\n2.0.3 In Person help\n\nStart by ask the person sitting next to you! Don’t hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help.\nAsk in the Math & Statistics Discord server - we have a dedicated channel just for this class but a lot of students in the server know how to use R.\nAttend Community Coding.\n\nDrop in work session & dedicated space to work on coding projects.\nCollaborate with your peers and learn from experts.\nSome hours are held over Zoom\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4 Other Online\n\nIn RStudio go to Help –&gt; Cheatsheets or to this URL https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/\nStack Overflow: if your question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on how to ask a good question.\nChico R Users Google Group.\nThe Posit Community: it is read by a lot of people and is welcoming to new users.\nIf your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list for it. Usually it’s included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can be accessed using `packageDescription(“name-of-package:. You may also want to try to email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the code repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n\n\n2.0.5 Using AI tools\n\nwrite guidance here\n\n\n\n2.0.6 Written\nIf you’re a book kinda person, there is plenty of help available as well.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). We will be working in R markdown files exclusively in this class, but it is important to be aware that there are also script files that have an extension of .R. These can contain code and comments only, not normal text sentences like this.\nBecause we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, and often your code may span several lines at a time, it is better to type the commands we want in a script, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer. It’s also easier to fix mistakes this way, without having to retype in the entire command.",

    "section": "4.2 Creating objects in R (Video)",
    "text": "4.2 Creating objects in R (Video)\nTo do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to objects. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator &lt;-, and the value we want to give it:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55\n\n&lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing x &lt;- 3, the value of x is 3.\nObjects can be given any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. However there are some naming guidelines you need to be aware of.\n\nYou want your object names to be explicit and not too long.\nThey cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).\nR is case sensitive (e.g., weight_kg is different from Weight_kg).\nThere are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list).\nIt’s best to not use other function names (e.g., c, T, mean, data, df, weights) because these already tend to be in use by different parts of R.\nSee Google’s style guide for more information.\n\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nNow that R has weight_kg in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\nWe can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\nThis means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new object, weight_lb:\n\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg\n\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\n\nR executes code in top-down order. So what happens on line 10 occurs before line 11. What do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\nComments. The comment character in R is #, anything to the right of a # in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes, and explanations in your scripts as demonstrated earlier.",

    "text": "4.3 Functions and their arguments (Video)\nFunctions are “canned scripts” that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R packages (lesson 02).\nA function usually takes one or more inputs called arguments, and often (but not always) return a value.\nA typical example would be the function sqrt(). The input is the number 4, and the return value (the output) is the square root of 4, namely 2. Executing a function (‘running it’) is called calling the function.\n\nsqrt(4)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nLet’s look into the round function.\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can learn more about this function by typing ?round. The Usage section of the help documentation shows you what the default values for each argument are. This is a very important piece to pay attention. Sometimes the default behaviors are not what you want to happen.\n\nround(x, digits=0)\n\nIn the Arguments section the help file defines what each argument does.\n\nx is the object that you want to round. It must be a numeric vector.\ndigits is an integer indicating the number of decimal places to round to.\n\nAbove, we called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it has returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type digits = 2 or however many we want.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIf you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don’t have to name them:\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAnd if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nThis is a simple function with only one argument. Functions are the backbone of how R does it’s thing. You will get lots of practice with functions, and quickly encounter functions that require many arguments.",

Factor variables in R are special types of categorical variables. We will learn how to work with factor variables in week 2.\n\n\n4.4.3 Boolean\nWhen the value of an object can only be TRUE or FALSE it is called a Boolean variable. These are created by writing a logical statement where the answer is either TRUE or FALSE. Silly examples include “Is 3 greater than 4?” and “Is the square root of 4 equal to 2?”\n\n3&gt;4\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsqrt(4)==2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nWe will see how to use these logical statements to do things such as subsetting data and creating new variables.",

    "section": "4.5 Data Structures (Video)",
    "text": "4.5 Data Structures (Video)\nData structures is how we refer to a collection of pieces of data, like a series of numbers, or a list of words.\n\n4.5.1 Vectors\nA vector is the most common and basic data structure in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R.\nWe can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\n(weight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82))\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\n(animals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\"))\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nAn important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. That is, each element in the vector has to be the same type. You can use the function class() to see what data type a vector is.\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIf you try to mix and match data types within a vector, some “coercion” will occur. If you combine letters and numbers, everything will be treated as letters.\n\n(mix_match &lt;- c(weight_g, animals))\n\n[1] \"50\"    \"60\"    \"65\"    \"82\"    \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\nclass(mix_match)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThis is VERY important to keep in mind when you import data into R from another program like Excel. If you have any letters (like the word “missing”, or “NA”) in a column, all data from that column will be treated as character strings. And you can’t do math (such as take a mean) on words.\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array). We will only talk about vectors,data.frames and factors in this class (not all in this lesson).\n\n\n4.5.2 Doing math on vectors\nYou can perform math operations on the elements of a vector such as\n\nweight_KG &lt;- weight_g/1000\nweight_KG\n\n[1] 0.050 0.060 0.065 0.082\n\n\nWhen adding two vectors together, the elements in the same position are added to each other. So element 1 in the vector a is added to element 1 in vector b.\n\na &lt;- c(1,2,3)\nb &lt;- c(6,7,8)\na+b\n\n[1]  7  9 11\n\n\nMore complex calculations can be performed on multiple vectors.\n\nwt_lb &lt;- c(155, 135, 90)\nht_in &lt;- c(72, 64, 50)\nbmi &lt;- 703*wt_lb / ht_in^2\nbmi\n\n[1] 21.01948 23.17017 25.30800\n\n\nAll these operations on vectors behave the same way when dealing with variables in a data set (data.frame).\nIf you want to add the values within a vector, you use functions such as sum(), max() and mean()\n\nsum(a)\n\n[1] 6\n\nmax(b)\n\n[1] 8\n\nmean(a+b)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Subsetting vectors\nIf we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[2]\n\n[1] \"rat\"\n\nanimals[c(2, 3)]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\nThe number in the indices indicates which element to extract. For example we can extract the 3rd element in weight_g by typing\n\nweight_g[3]\n\n[1] 65\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Conditional subsetting\nAnother common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. TRUE will select the element with the same index, while FALSE will not. Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests such as:\n\nweight_g &gt; 50  # returns TRUE or FALSE depending on which elements that meet the condition\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can use this output to select elements in a different vector where the value of that logical statement is TRUE. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values where weight in grams is above 50 we would type:\n\nweight_g[weight_g &gt; 50]\n\n[1] 60 65 82\n\n\nYou can combine multiple tests using & (both conditions are true, AND) or | (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):\nWeight is less than 30g or greater than 60g\n\nweight_g[weight_g &lt; 30 | weight_g &gt; 60]\n\n[1] 65 82\n\n\nWeight is between 60 and 80lbs\n\nweight_g[weight_g &gt;= 60 & weight_g &lt;= 80]\n\n[1] 60 65\n\n\nHere, &lt; stands for “less than”, &gt; for “greater than”, &gt;= for “greater than or equal to”, and == for “equal to”. The double equal sign == is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single = sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to &lt;-).\nA common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could use the “or” operator | to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious. The function %in% allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[animals == \"cat\" | animals == \"rat\"] # returns both rat and cat\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"cat\"\n\nanimals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\")\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nanimals[animals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\")]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"dog\" \"cat\"\n\n\n\n\n4.5.5 Order matters.\nWhen considering string or character vectors or data elements, R treats everything in alphabetical order. Thus\n\n\"four\" &gt; \"five\"\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis will come back to bug you when dealing with categorical data types called factors in a later lesson. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how to be the boss of your factors and not let R tell you that “one” is greater than “four”.",

Ideally each row represents data on a single observation and each column contains data on a single variable, or characteristic, of the observation. This is called tidy data. This is an important concept that you are encouraged to read more about if you will be doing your own data collection and research. This article is a good place to start.\nA data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector.\n\n\n\nfigure depicting a data frame\n\n\nFor this part of the lesson we will use a data set called diamonds that comes with the ggplot2 package that you installed as part of lesson 02.

Let’s try them out!\n\nSize:\n\ndim(diamonds) - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object)\nnrow(diamonds) - returns the number of rows\nncol(diamonds) - returns the number of columns\n\nContent:\n\nhead(diamonds) - shows the first 6 rows\ntail(diamonds) - shows the last 6 rows\n\nNames:\n\nnames(diamonds) - returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects)\nrownames(diamonds) - returns the row names\n\nSummary:\n\nstr(diamonds) - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column\nsummary(diamonds) - summary statistics for each column\n\n\nNote: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides a data.frame\n\n\n4.6.2 Identifying variables\nData frames can be subset by specifying indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:\ndiamonds[, \"depth\"]\ndiamonds[, 5] \ndiamonds$depth\nThe $ notation has the format data$variable and so can be thought of as specifying which data set the variable is in. It is easy to imagine a situation where two different data sets have the same name.\nThis allows us to perform calculations on an individual variable. Below is an example of finding the average price for all diamonds in the data set.\n\nmean(diamonds$price)\n\n[1] 3932.8\n\n\nYou can also subset a variable based on the value of a secondary variable. Here is an example of finding the average price for Good quality diamonds.\n\nmean(diamonds$price[diamonds$cut==\"Good\"])\n\n[1] 3928.864\n\n\nNote that the $ is used in both locations where we want to identify a variable.",

Missing values can cause some problems during analysis, so let’s see how to detect missing values and how to work around them.\nConsider the ncbirths data set, specifically the first column containing data on the father’s age (fage).\n\nhead(ncbirths)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n   fage  mage mature    weeks premie visits marital gained weight lowbirthweight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         \n1    NA    13 younger …    39 full …     10 not ma…     38   7.63 not low       \n2    NA    14 younger …    42 full …     15 not ma…     20   7.88 not low       \n3    19    15 younger …    37 full …     11 not ma…     38   6.63 not low       \n4    21    15 younger …    41 full …      6 not ma…     34   8    not low       \n5    NA    15 younger …    39 full …      9 not ma…     27   6.38 not low       \n6    NA    15 younger …    38 full …     19 not ma…     22   5.38 low           \n# ℹ 3 more variables: gender &lt;fct&gt;, habit &lt;fct&gt;, whitemom &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\n\nR puts a NA as a placeholder when the value for that piece of data is missing.\nMissing data can be a result of many things: skip patterns in a survey (i.e. non-smokers don’t get asked how many packs per week they smoke), errors in data reads from a machine, etc.\n\nProblem 1 R can’t do arithmetic on missing data. So 5 + NA = NA, and if you were to try to calculate the mean() of a variable, you’d also get NA.\n\nmean(ncbirths$fage)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nProblem 2 Some plots will show NA as it’s own category, which is undesirable.\n\nggplot(ncbirths, aes(premie))+geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Identifying missing values\nTo find out how many values in a particular variable are missing we can use one of two approaches:\n\nLook at the raw data using head() or str(). This may not be helpful if there is no missing values in the first 6 rows, or if there is a large number of variables to look through.\nLook at data summaries using table() for categorical data and summary() for numerical data. In the examples below you can see that entries for “NA” are included in the output.\n\n\ntable(ncbirths$habit, useNA=\"always\")\n\n\nnonsmoker    smoker      &lt;NA&gt; \n      873       126         1 \n\nsummary(ncbirths$fage)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Calling the function is.na() on the vector x, results in three values, where only the second one is TRUE – meaning the second element is missing.\nThis can be extended to do things such as using the sum() function to count the number of missing values in a variable. Here we are nesting the functions is.na() is written entirely inside the sum() function.\n\nsum(is.na(ncbirths$fage))\n\n[1] 171\n\n\nThere are 171 records in this data set where the age for the father is not present.",

In fact it’s so commonly used with dplyr functions that it the magrittr package is loaded when you load dplyr (which is what we do here). However, the pipe operator is so useful in many other places that it deserves it’s own introduction here.\n\n“and then….”\n\nThis is what I read to myself when using the pipe (%&gt;%). The pipe lets you chain functions together, as long as the first argument of the function is a data.frame or a variable in a data.frame.\n\n5.6.1 Example: Frequency tables & summary statistics\nEarlier we saw that to create a frequency table for categorical variable we can type:\n\ntable(ncbirths$mature)\n\n\n mature mom younger mom \n        133         867 \n\n\nThis is also accomplished by first stating the variable, then piping in the summary function.\n\nIf you get an error message saying something like function not found, that is a message to you that you need to load the library.

This is ordinal data, in that none is inherently “smaller” than small, which is smaller than big. Though R correctly ordered these data, it may default to alphabetical order in other cases, so beware! You may need to correct the ordering for other data sets.\nLet’s see a few ways of how to control the ordering.\n\n6.4.1 Manually specified\nWe need to take control of these factors! We can do that by re-factoring the existing factor variable, but this time specifying the levels of the factor (since it already has labels). Say we decide to reverse the order so we go from big to small to none, in decreasing order of size.\nBase R\n\nfactor(email$number, levels=c(\"big\", \"small\", \"none\")) %&gt;% table()\n\n.\n  big small  none \n  545  2827   549 \n\n\nforcats\n\nemail$number %&gt;% fct_relevel(\"big\", \"small\", \"none\") %&gt;% table()\n\n.\n  big small  none \n  545  2827   549 \n\n\nIn each of these examples, I pipe (%&gt;%) the table() function at the end so I can see the results of the reordering. This helps me visually confirm that the code used changed the factor levels to be left to right in decreasing content size order. This will be important for graphing.\n\nSince I did not use the assignment operator (&lt;-) here, these changes were not made to the variable in the email data set. The examples below demonstrate making an adjustmet to a factor variable and saving that adjustment as a new variable in the data set.",

This is ALWAYS the first argument.\naes(): This is the aesthetics of the plot. What variable is on the x, and what is on the y? Do you want to color by another variable, perhaps fill some box by the value of another variable, or group by a variable.\ngeom_THING(): Every plot has to have a geometry. What is the shape of the thing you want to plot? Do you want to plot point? Use geom_points(). Want to connect those points with a line? Use geom_lines().

    "text": "7.2 Univariate (One Variable) (Video)\n\n7.2.1 Categorical variables\nBoth Nominal and Ordinal data types can be visualized using the same methods: tables, barcharts and pie charts.\n\n7.2.1.1 Tables\nTables are the most common way to get summary statistics of a categorical variable. The table() function produces a frequency table, where each entry represents the number of records in the data set holding the corresponding labeled value.\n\ntable(dsmall$cut)\n\n\n     Fair      Good Very Good   Premium     Ideal \n       34        99       220       257       390 \n\n\nThere are 34 Fair quality diamonds, 99 Good quality diamonds, and 390 Ideal quality diamonds in this sample.\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Barcharts / Barplots\nA Barchart or barplot takes these frequencies, and draws bars along the X-axis where the height of the bars is determined by the frequencies seen in the table.\nThe geometry needed to draw a barchart in ggplot is geom_bar().\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can reorder these levels on the fly so they are being shown in decreasing frequency using the fct_infreq function from the forcats library.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=forcats::fct_infreq(cut))) + geom_bar() + xlab(\"cut\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial note. The :: notation is a shortcut to use a function from inside a package without actually loading the entire package. This can be useful when you’re only using a function once or twice in an analysis.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Continuous variable\nThe price, carat, and depth of the diamonds are all continuous variables. Let’s explore the distribution of price.\n\n7.2.2.1 Histograms\nRather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin. The height of the bars in a histogram display the frequency of values that fall into those of those bins.\nSince the x-axis is continuous the bars touch. This is unlike the barchart that has a categorical x-axis, and vertical bars that are separated.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price)) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Density plots\nTo get a better idea of the true shape of the distribution we can “smooth” out the bins and create what’s called a density plot or curve. Notice that the shape of this distribution curve is much… “wigglier” than the histogram may have implied.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2.3 Histograms + density\nOften it is more helpful to have the density (or kernel density) plot on top of a histogram plot.\n\nThe syntax starts the same: we’ll add a new geom, geom_density and color the line blue.\nThen we add the histogram geom using geom_histogram but must specify that the y axis should be on the density, not frequency, scale.\n\nNote that this has to go inside the aesthetic statement aes().\n\nI’m also going to get rid of the fill by using NA so the colored bars don’t plot over the density line.\n\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price)) + geom_density(col=\"blue\") + \n  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour=\"black\", fill=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2.4 Boxplots\nAnother very common way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is using a boxplot. Boxplots are useful for quickly identifying where the bulk of your data lie. R specifically draws a “modified” boxplot where values that are considered outliers are plotted as dots.\n\n7.2.2.4.1 base\n\nboxplot(dsmall$price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only axis labeled is the y=axis. Like a dotplot the x axis, or “width”, of the boxplot is meaningless here. We can make the axis more readable by flipping the plot on its side.\n\nboxplot(dsmall$price, horizontal = TRUE, main=\"Distribution of diamond prices\", xlab=\"Dollars\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal is a bit easier to read in my opinion.\nWhat about ggplot? ggplot doesn’t really like to do univariate boxplots. You’ll see those later when we create one boxplot per group.\n\n\n\n7.2.2.5 New variable\nBefore we move on, I want to see price displayed as ranges of 5,000 instead of a continuous measure from 0 to 20,000. I will us the cut_width function to create a new categorical variable here called price_range. See this page for this, and other functions in ggplot that discretize numeric data into categorical.\n\ndsmall$price_range &lt;- cut_width(dsmall$price/1000, width=5)\n\nNotice I also divided price by 1000, so 2.5 means 2500. Now that price_range is a categorical variable, I can create a barchart to visualize the frequencies of each bin.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price_range)) + geom_bar()",

This has the effect of visualizing the row percents from the table above. Here it is the percent of price_range, within each type of cut.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut, fill=price_range)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default is a stacked barchart. So add the argument position=dodge inside the geom_bar layer to put the bars side by side.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=cut, fill=price_range)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd look, an automatic legend. What if I wanted to better compare cut within price range? This is the column percentages. Just switch which variable is the x axis and which one is used to fill the colors!\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price_range, fill=cut)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this easy change is why we love ggplot2.\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Continuous v. Continuous\n\n7.3.2.1 Scatterplot\nThe most common method of visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables is by using a scatterplot.\nWith ggplot we specify both the x and y variables, and add a point.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2.1.1 Adding lines to the scatterplots\nTwo most common trend lines added to a scatterplots are the “best fit” straight line and the “lowess” smoother line. This is done by adding a geom_smooth() layer.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the point-wise confidence interval for this lowess line is shown in grey. If you want to turn the confidence interval off, use se=FALSE. Also notice that the smoothing geom uses a different function or window than the lowess function used in base graphics.\nHere it is again using the ggplot plotting function and adding another geom_smooth() layer for the lm (linear model) line in blue, and the lowess line (by not specifying a method) in red.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method=\"lm\", color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Continuous v. Categorical\nCreate an appropriate plot for a continuous variable, and plot it for each level of the categorical variable by shading the plots or coloring the lines depending on the group.\n\n7.3.3.1 Overlaid density plots\nYou could fill the density curves depending on the group, but then it’s hard to see overlap.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth, fill=cut)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can adjust the transparency of the density curve by applying a value to alpha inside the density layer. Alpha is a measure of transparency, from 0=clear to 1=opaque.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth, fill=cut)) + geom_density(alpha=.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that there are some premium cut diamonds with depths around 62. This peak was hidden from us before.\nYou could also just color the lines and leave the fill alone.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=depth, color=cut)) + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe won’t talk about changing colors or the background in this lab, but the yellow is pretty hard to read.\n\n\n7.3.3.2 Grouped boxplots\nggplot is happy to do grouped boxplots. Put the continuous variable on the y, categorical on the x.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price_range, y=carat)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3.2.1 Adding violins to the boxplot\nA violin plot is like a density plot, turned on its side, and reflected around the axis for symmetry purposes. Overlaying a boxplot and a violin plot serves a similar purpose to Histograms + Density plots. It shows outliers, the location of most the data, and better shows the shape/skew of the distribution. Let’s also fill the geometries with the same color as what is on the x-axis. Not 100% needed but nice for display sometimes.\n\nggplot(dsmall, aes(x=price_range, y=carat, fill=price_range)) +\n        geom_violin(alpha=.1) + \n        geom_boxplot(alpha=.5, width=.2)",

These are not as furry and prolific as their cousins the tribbles. tibbles behaves for all intents and purposes as a data.frame, just gets displayed differently.

    "text": "8.2 Basic verbs (Video)\nThe dplyr package contains new data manipulation functions, also called verbs. We will look at the following verbs:\n\nfilter(): Returns a subset of the rows.\nselect(): Returns only the listed columns.\nrename(): Renames the variables listed.\nmutate(): Adds columns from existing data.\nsummarise(): Reduces each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.\ngroup_by(): Groups a data set on a factor variable, such that all functions performed are then done on each level of the factor.\n\n\n8.2.1 Filter\nfilter() allows you to select a subset of the rows of a data frame. The first argument is the name of the data frame, and the second and subsequent are filtering expressions evaluated in the context of that data frame. For example, we can select all flights on January 1st with\n\nfilter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)\n\n# A tibble: 842 × 19\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819\n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830\n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850\n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022\n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837\n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728\n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854\n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723\n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846\n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745\n# ℹ 832 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;,\n#   tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;\n\n\nfilter() works similarly to subset() except that you can give it any number of filtering conditions which are joined together with &.

There is no assignment operator &lt;- used here, so this change is not going to persist into later code.\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Mutate\nAs well as selecting from the set of existing columns, it’s often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. This is the job of mutate()!\nHere we create two variables: gain (as arrival delay minus departure delay) and speed (as distance divided by time, converted to hours).\n\na &lt;- mutate(flights, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, \n                speed = distance / air_time * 60)\nselect(a, gain, distance, air_time, speed)\n\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 4\n    gain distance air_time speed\n   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     9     1400      227  370.\n 2    16     1416      227  374.\n 3    31     1089      160  408.\n 4   -17     1576      183  517.\n 5   -19      762      116  394.\n 6    16      719      150  288.\n 7    24     1065      158  404.\n 8   -11      229       53  259.\n 9    -5      944      140  405.\n10    10      733      138  319.\n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n\n\nOne key advantage of mutate is that you can refer to the columns you just created. Mutate flights to create two variables, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay and gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60).\n\nmutate(flights, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, \n                gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60 ))\n\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 21\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819\n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830\n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850\n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022\n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837\n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728\n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854\n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723\n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846\n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745\n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n# ℹ 13 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;,\n#   tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;, gain &lt;dbl&gt;, gain_per_hour &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n8.2.5 Summarize\nThe last verb is summarise(), which collapses a data frame to a single row. It’s not very useful yet. We can create a new variable called delay that is the average departure delay on the entire flights data set.\n\nsummarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  delay\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  12.6",

    "text": "8.3 Grouped Operations (Video)\nThe above verbs are useful, but they become really powerful when you combine them with the idea of “group by”, repeating the operation individually on groups of observations within the dataset. In dplyr, you use the group_by() function to describe how to break a dataset down into groups of rows. You can then use the resulting object in exactly the same functions as above; they’ll automatically work “by group” when the input is a grouped.\nLet’s demonstrate how some of these functions work after grouping the flights data set by month. First we’ll create a new data set that is grouped by month.\n\nby_month &lt;- group_by(flights, month)\n\n\nThe summarise() verb allows you to calculate summary statistics for each group.

    "text": "8.4 Chaining Operations (Video)\nConsider the following group of operations that take the data set flights, and produce a final data set (a4) that contains only the flights where the daily average delay is greater than a half hour.\n\na1 &lt;- group_by(flights, year, month, day)\na2 &lt;- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)\n\nAdding missing grouping variables: `year`, `month`, `day`\n\na3 &lt;- summarise(a2,\n                arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n                dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\na4 &lt;- filter(a3, arr &gt; 30 | dep &gt; 30)\nhead(a4)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n# Groups:   year, month [3]\n   year month   day   arr   dep\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2013     1    16  34.2  24.6\n2  2013     1    31  32.6  28.7\n3  2013     2    11  36.3  39.1\n4  2013     2    27  31.3  37.8\n5  2013     3     8  85.9  83.5\n6  2013     3    18  41.3  30.1\n\n\nIt does the trick, but what if you don’t want to save all the intermediate results (a1 - a3)? Well these verbs are function, so they can be wrapped inside other functions to create a nesting type structure.\n\nfilter(\n  summarise(\n    select(\n      group_by(flights, year, month, day),\n      arr_delay, dep_delay\n    ),\n    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ),\n  arr &gt; 30 | dep &gt; 30\n)\n\nWoah, that is HARD to read! This is difficult to read because the order of the operations is from inside to out, and the arguments are a long way away from the function. To get around this problem, dplyr provides the %&gt;% operator. x %&gt;% f(y) turns into f(x, y) so you can use it to rewrite multiple operations so you can read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom:\n\nflights %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, month, day) %&gt;%\n  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(arr &gt; 30 | dep &gt; 30)\n\nAdding missing grouping variables: `year`, `month`, `day`\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 49 × 5\n# Groups:   year, month [11]\n    year month   day   arr   dep\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2013     1    16  34.2  24.6\n 2  2013     1    31  32.6  28.7\n 3  2013     2    11  36.3  39.1\n 4  2013     2    27  31.3  37.8\n 5  2013     3     8  85.9  83.5\n 6  2013     3    18  41.3  30.1\n 7  2013     4    10  38.4  33.0\n 8  2013     4    12  36.0  34.8\n 9  2013     4    18  36.0  34.9\n10  2013     4    19  47.9  46.1\n# ℹ 39 more rows\n\n\nAnother way you can read this is by thinking “and then” when you see the %&gt;% operator. So the above code takes the data set flights\n.. and then groups by day\n.. and then selects the delay variables\n.. and then calculates the means\n.. and then filters on a delay over half hour.\nThe same 4 steps that resulted in the a4 data set, but without all the intermediate data saved! This can be very important when dealing with Big Data. R stores all data in memory, so if your little computer only has 2G of RAM and you’re working with a data set that is 500M in size, your computers memory will be used up fast. a1 takes 500M, a2 another 500M, by now your computer is getting slow. Make another copy at a3 and it gets worse, a4 now likely won’t even be able to be created because you’ll be out of memory.",

The three different files we will be using have different file types, or extensions.\n\nemail.txt is a .txt or “text” file.\nNCBirths.csv is a .csv or “comma separated values” file.\nfatal-police-shootings-data.xlsx is a .xlsx or Excel file.\n\nEach of these file types differ in the type of delimiter used. The delimiter is a character or symbol that separates columns of data from each other when stored in an external file. Recall back to the earlier lesson on data frames and matrices. Each column in the matrix represented data on a specific variable. Something had to tell R how to distinguish which values went with which variable.\nThere are two main types of delimiters we will consider in this class; comma and tab. That does not mean that data can’t be stored in other ways, these are just the two most common.\nEach of these different data types requires a different function or mechanism to import the data into R. If you use the wrong mechanism, the data may not be read in correctly if at all.",

    "text": "9.3 General Importing data (Video)\nTo import data into R, we have to tell the program explicitly where to find the files you just downloaded. To do that we need to find the file’s path. The path is a programmatic way to direct your computer to the location of a file. It’s like the file’s address, or, where it lives on your computer. \nIn all the examples below, the path shown (data/) is the path on MY computer. You will have to update this path to YOUR path on YOUR machine that points to your MATH130 folder.\nYou can find the path of a file by navigating to the desired file in your finder or browser window. Right click and copy the file to the clipboard, then right click and pasting into a R markdown file. This will show a path that looks something like this:\nfile:///C:/Math 130/Data/Challenger.txt\nYou will need to remove the file:/// part at the beginning before using this path. You will have three chances in this lab to practice this.\n\n9.3.1 Special Instructions for Mac\n\nNavigate to the file or folder you wish to copy the path for Right-click (or Control+Click, or a Two-Finger click on trackpads) on the file or folder in the Mac Finder\nWhile in the right-click menu, hold down the OPTION key to reveal the “Copy (item name) as Pathname” option, which replaces the standard Copy option. Once selected, the file or folders path is now in the clipboard, ready to be pasted anywhere\n\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52695546/how-to-copy-path-of-a-file-in-mac-os",

Here are three:\n\nstr() to show you the structure of the data frame.\nhead() to show you the top 6 rows\ndata[1:x, 1:x] - when the data frame is too large for the above two to work well, we can use matrix notation to view only the first X columns, and first X rows.\n\nNext we will read in three different data sets, each with unique file types, and look at each one to make sure it was read in correctly.",

Uncommon delimiters could include a % or even a semi-colon. By opening the file directly on your computer (not in R) you can see what delimiter is being used.\nWe will use the read.table() function that is in base R to read in any type of delimited file. A tab-delimited text file can be read in using \"\\t\" as the deliminator character. In this class you ALWAYS want to include header=TRUE to signify that the data in the first row contains our column names.\n\nemail &lt;- read.table(\"data/email.txt\", header=TRUE, sep=\"\\t\")\n\nHere we call the str() or structure function to examine the data that was imported.\n\nstr(email)\n\n'data.frame':   3921 obs. of  21 variables:\n $ spam        : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ to_multiple : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ...\n $ from        : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ cc          : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ sent_email  : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ...\n $ time        : chr  \"2011-12-31 22:16:41\" \"2011-12-31 23:03:59\" \"2012-01-01 08:00:32\" \"2012-01-01 01:09:49\" ...\n $ image       : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ attach      : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ dollar      : int  0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ winner      : chr  \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ inherit     : int  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ viagra      : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ password    : int  0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ num_char    : num  11.37 10.5 7.77 13.26 1.23 ...\n $ line_breaks : int  202 202 192 255 29 25 193 237 69 68 ...\n $ format      : int  1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ re_subj     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ exclaim_subj: int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ urgent_subj : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ exclaim_mess: int  0 1 6 48 1 1 1 18 1 0 ...\n $ number      : chr  \"big\" \"small\" \"small\" \"small\" ...\n\n\n\nThe email data set has 3921 observations, and 21 variables.\nThe variable names were read in correctly, as evidenced by the words in the far right corner after the $.\nMost variables are treated as numeric integers, except a few are factors.

We may or may not want to change that later.\nNumeric variables such as age are of type dbl (double). This is similar to integer or numeric, so we are fine.",

To accomplish this in ggplot is doable, but involves pre-calculating the percentages first and then plotting the summary numbers. This is a great place to introduce a different package: sjPlot.\nggplot2 is pretty great for easy out-of-the-box plots that don’t look half bad. Well for something a bit better when it comes to labeled barcharts let’s turn to the sjPlot package. Note this package uses ggplot graphics, but does not follow the syntax. So you’ll need to reference the vignette often to to learn more of what this package can do and what syntax it uses.\nTo plot the frequency distribution of a single categorical variable we use the “plot freq” function plot_frq\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\nplot_frq(email$number)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot the results of a contingency table we can use the plot_xtab function.\n\nplot_xtab(NCbirths$mature, NCbirths$marital)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, you MUST do a common sense check on the proportions that are shown, which also means knowing what the default settings for a function are. The defaults for plot_xtab show the proportion of the fill variable, within the variable that’s on the x. In context of the plot above, 17.5% of women who are not married are mature moms. 86.8% of all moms are younger moms.\nYou can see the available adjustments using function arguments by reviewing the vignette for that function. Here I will turn off the total column by adding show.total=FALSE and turn it into row percents by adding margin='row'.\n\nplot_xtab(NCbirths$mature, NCbirths$marital, margin='row', show.total = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow 81.1% of mature moms are not married, and 41.6% of younger moms are married. Always make sure your %’s being displayed match your interpretation.",
