<section id="software" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="software">Software</h4>
<p>If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install R and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what you’ve learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are free. Walk through installation instructions can be found on the course website: <a href="https://math130.netlify.app/setup_tools">https://math130.netlify.app/setup_tools</a></p>
<!--updateme --->
<ul>
<li>R version 4.5.1 or later.</li>
<li>R Studio version 2025.05.01 or later</li>
<li>Download both from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who do not have a computer that they install programs on (i.e.&nbsp;a iPad or Chromebook) can use the <a href="https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=112333">Wildcat virtual lab</a>, or sign up for <a href="https://posit.cloud">Posit Cloud</a>.

<section id="time-commitment" class="level1">
<h1>Time Commitment</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the “credit hour” is defined as … not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during these 5 weeks. That’s 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time during week 5 to work on the project.</p>
<p>You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path where you can continue to learn and improve.</p>

Submitting files not in the requested format will not be graded, but you can resubmit for full credit. <!--be marked down, but you can resubmit for full credit. --></p>
<section id="gradescope" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gradescope">Gradescope</h3>
<p>Gradescope is a third party program that allows for an improved grading platform. You will submit your homework assignments in Canvas by clicking on a link that will take you to the appropriate location in Gradescope. You can log directly into Gradescope using your Chico State SSO login.</p>
<p>Logging into Gradescope gives you the ability to see your comments and grading breakdown based on a rubric, and to request regrades to your assignments as necessary. Feedback and rubrics are not available in Canvas.</p>
<!--- 
Assignments are submit by uploading the appropriate files to a Google
Drive shared notebook, which I will create for you.  The shared Google
Drive folder will be named MATH 130 Assignments for
[student-username], where [student-username] is your student username.
Only, specifically, you, me, and the course graders will have access
to this folder.

<p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which may lead to a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address the concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</li>
<li>We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
