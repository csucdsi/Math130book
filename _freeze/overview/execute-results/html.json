You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in Section @sec-install.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Why use R?\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n-   Open source, cross-platform, and free\n-   Great for reproducibility\n-   Tons of learning resources\n-   Works on data of all shapes and sizes\n-   Produces high-quality graphics\n-   Large and welcoming community\n-   Flexible and extensible. Doesn't do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.\n-   Currently R is used in many upper division & graduate level Statistics and Research methods courses in domains such as Public Health, Economics, Finance, and Political Science.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![Manual car gear shift representing coding in R <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/D19rXKDUPYM\">Photo credit</a>](img/r-manual.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Manual car gear shift representing coding in R\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n### Why use R Studio?\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n-   Customizable workspace that docks all windows together.\n-   Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)\n-   Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.\n-   Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.\n-   Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.\n-   One button publishing of [reproducible documents](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) such as reports, dashboards, presentations, websites like this one!\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n![Automatic car gear shift representing RStudio integrated development environment <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Wec3M4dY_LE\">Photo credit</a>](img/r-automatic.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Automatic car gear shift representing RStudio integrated development environment\" fig-align=\"center\"} \n:::\n\n::::\n\n \n\n\n\n\n## Programming can be scary!\nIt's important to acknowledge that computer programming is a new skill, that may bring a roller coaster of emotions with it while you learn. \n\n![Learning curve diagram by Allison Horst showing how much you think you know about R over time](img/r-learning-curve-horst.png){fig-alt=\"Line chart labeled 'How much I think I know about R' versus time, showing ups and downs with smiley faces at different stages.\" width=\"600\"}\n\n[<a href = \"https://allisonhorst.com/\">Artwork by @allison_horst – used under CC BY 4.0.</a>]{.aside}\n\nBut you don't have to go at it alone! You are now part of a _learning community_ that you can lean on for questions and support. \n\n![Coding is a social activity!](img/r-community.png){fig-alt=\"A person in a cape that reads “code hero” who looks like they are flying through the air while typing on a computer while saying “I’m doing a think all on my own!” The coder’s arms and legs have ropes attached to two hot air balloons lifting them up, with labels on the balloons including “teachers”, “bloggers”, “friends”, “developers”. Below the code hero, several people carry a trampoline with labels “support” and “community” that will catch them if they fall\" width=\"600\"}\n[<a href = \"https://datascience.csuchico.edu/communitycoding\">Drop in help available at Community Coding</a>]{.aside}\n\nLearning to program has lots of benefits\n\n-   Improves your logical skills and critical problem solving\n-   Increases your attention to detail\n-   Increases your self reliance and empowers you to control your own research.\n-   Your PI will love your awesome graphics and reports.\n-   Some people think what you do is magic.\n-   Thinking graduate school? [expect to learn this on your own](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)\n-   [A few](https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/28/laurence-bradford-10-reasons/) [other lists](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-benefits-of-learning-to-code/) [of reasons](https://skillcrush.com/2017/01/30/learn-to-code-benefits/)\n\n### Why no point and click?\n\nBecause it's not reproducible.\n\n-   Which boxes did you click last time?\n-   New data? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...\n\n\n\n## How this book is organized\n\n<!---\n* videos\n* sections (intro/intermediate)\n* how to use with assignments in an LMS\n--->\n\n### Callout blocks\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"General Information\"}\nBlack boxes contain notes and information for you to be aware of (Blue in dark mode). \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"You Try It!\"}\nGreen boxes contain \"you try it\" examples for you to try on your computer. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Danger\"}\nRed boxes contain warnings such as common errors or pitfalls. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Follow along videos\"}\nYellow boxes contain links to supporting videos. \n:::\n\nSometimes there are side notes presented in the right margin [Over Here!]{.aside}\n\n🚧 Section under construction\n\n### Code and keystroke appearance\n\nIn these notes, code that is referenced in text is `displayed in this format`, code is executed (run) by R is displayed like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nwhere the output or result of the code is displayed directly after. The `[1]` that is sometimes displayed with the output helps count the lines of output (sometimes), and can be ignored _most_ of the time. \n\nWhen giving instructions on which keys to press, buttons are shown as boxes like <kbd>CTRL</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd> . \n\n## Getting and Submitting Assignments\n\nAll assignment files can be found in @sec-assignments. Submission instructions vary by instructor so check your syllabus for details.  \n\n\n",
