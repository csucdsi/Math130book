You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in @sec-install\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Why use R?\n\n-   Open source, cross-platform, and free\n-   Great for reproducibility\n-   Flexible and extensible. Doesn't do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.\n-   Tons of learning resources\n-   Currently R is used in many upper division & graduate level Statistics and Research methods courses in domains such as Public Health, Economics, Finance, and Political Science.\n-   Does not involve lots of pointing and clicking (that's a good thing!)\n-   Works on data of all shapes and sizes\n-   Produces high-quality graphics\n-   Large and welcoming community\n\n### Why use R Studio?\n\n-   Customizable workspace that docks all windows together.\n-   Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)\n-   Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.\n-   Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.\n-   Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.\n-   Free training videos available from the developers directly.\n-   One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, dashboards, presentations (like this one!), websites.\n\n[See a gallery of other examples at <a href = \"https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/\"> https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/</a>]{.aside}\n\n## Programming can be scary!\nIt's important to acknowledge that computer programming is a new skill, that may bring a roller coaster of emotions with it while you learn. \n\n![Learning curve diagram by Allison Horst showing how much you think you know about R over time](img/r-learning-curve-horst.png){fig-alt=\"Line chart labeled 'How much I think I know about R' versus time, showing ups and downs with smiley faces at different stages.\" width=\"600\"}\n[<a href = \"https://allisonhorst.com/\">Artwork by @allison_horst – used under CC BY 4.0.</a>]{.aside}\n\nLearning to program has lots of benefits\n\n-   Improves your logical skills and critical problem solving\n-   Increases your attention to detail\n-   Increases your self reliance and empowers you to control your own research.\n-   Your PI will love your awesome graphics and reports.\n-   Some people think what you do is magic.\n-   Thinking graduate school? [expect to learn this on your own](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)\n-   [A few](https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/28/laurence-bradford-10-reasons/) [other lists](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-benefits-of-learning-to-code/) [of reasons](https://skillcrush.com/2017/01/30/learn-to-code-benefits/)\n\n### Why no point and click?\n\nBecause it's not reproducible.\n\n-   Which boxes did you click last time?\n-   New data? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...\n\n\n\n## How this book is organized\n\n<!---\n* videos\n* sections (intro/intermediate)\n* how to use with assignments in an LMS\n--->\n\n### Callout blocks\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"General Information\"}\nBlack boxes contain notes and information for you to be aware of (Blue in dark mode). \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"You Try It!\"}\nGreen boxes contain \"you try it\" examples for you to try on your computer. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Danger\"}\nRed boxes contain warnings such as common errors or pitfalls. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Caution\"}\nnot sure if using yellow boxes \n:::\n\n### Follow along videos\nSections that have associated videos will be denoted with a 🎦. \n### Code appearance\n\nIn these notes, code is displayed like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nwhere the output or result of the code is displayed directly after. \n\n",
