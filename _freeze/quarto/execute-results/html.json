It combines the functionalities of various tools into a single platform, making it easier to produce reproducible and collaborative scientific content. If you have heard of R Markdown - Quarto is the \"next generation\" of R Markdown.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Learning Objectives\"}\nAfter completing this lesson learners will be able to:\n\n-   Write code and text in a Quarto document\n-   Identify components of a Quarto document\n-   Compile Quarto documents into both HTML and PDF formats\n-   Understand the difference between running code interactively, and rendering an entire new document.\n:::\n\nWhile Quarto is also it's own standalone program, it comes \"built-in\" to R Studio so [**no additional installations needed!**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\n## Document structure\n\nQuarto is an example of literate programming where the explanation of the program (or analysis) logic is presented in a natural language (such as English), with supporting pieces of code embedded in the document itself. Quarto combines normal text such as this sentence, code and the output from the code all in one file. It is similar to a scientific lab notebook where a scientist can write down their hypotheses, code to produce graphs and analysis results, and the discussion of those findings.\n\n![A Quarto document with the extension .qmd (on the left), along with its rendered version as HTML (on the right).

Make sure you are in your Math 130 Project. (ref @sec-rproj)\n2.  From the file pane, open the `_hello.qmd` quarto document\n3.  Click \"Render\" at the top of this file.\n\n:::\n\nThe ![](img/rstudio-render-button.png){width=\"25\"} Render button in the RStudio IDE *compiles* or *renders* the file and opens a preview of the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut <kbd>SHIFT+COMMAND+K</kbd>.\n\n![The Render button](img/rstudio-render.png)\n\n## Components of a Quarto file {#sec-quarto-components}\n\nQuarto files contains three types of content:\n\n1.  A YAML header\n2.  Code chunks\n3.  Markdown text\n\n### YAML Header\n\nAn YAML header is demarcated by three dashes (---) on top and bottom. R is pretty finicky about these three dashes, so try not to disturb them. \n\nWhen rendered, the title, `\"Hello, Quarto\"`, will appear at the top of the rendered document with a larger font size than the rest of the document. The other two YAML fields denote that the output should be in `html format` and the document should open in the `visual editor` by default.\n\nThe basic syntax of YAML uses key-value pairs in the format `key: value`. Other YAML fields commonly found in headers of documents include metadata like `author:` and `date:`.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Add your name\" icon=false}\n\n1.  Add a line after the title for an `author:` and put your name here.\n2.  Click the \"Source\" button at the top left corner of the `Source` window.\n3.  Render the document again.\n\n:::\n\n**Visual vs Source mode** RStudio’s **Visual** editor offers a [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) [WYSIWYM: What You See Is What You Mean]{.aside} authoring experience for markdown formatting of text. Each view has it's benefits and drawbacks, and which you choose to use is purely a matter of personal preference.\n\n![The same Quarto document in the two modes of the RStudio editor: visual (on the left) and source (on the right).](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-source-visual.png)\n\n### Code Chunks\n\nCode chunks start with three back ticks ` ``` ` [a back tick is the key to the left of the 1 on your keyboard]{.aside} and an `{r}` in braces. Chunks close (end) with another three back ticks. [Note the background color of this section has changed to a different shade. This helps you identify you have closed your code chunk properly.]{.aside}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| eval: false\n2+2\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* You can insert code chunks by using the button in the top right of an RMD file (Insert -> R), or by typing  <kbd>CTRL+ALT+I</kbd>.\n* R code chunks can also have a YAML style header, prefixed by a \"hash-pipe\" `#|` at the top of the code chunk. [`|` is the first of three pipes we'll see in this course]{.aside}  In this case I set `eval` to `false` to prevent the code inside this code chunk from being run when I render the whole document. \n\n:::{.callout-important title = \"Only code goes in code chunks\"}\n\nThat's why they're called `code` chunks. No normal text. All explanatory text goes outside code chunks in normal Markdown text. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Make a change\" icon=false}\n\nPlay around with modifying the text and the R code.\n\n1.  Change `echo:false` to `echo:true` in the `plot-penguins` code chunk header. \n2.  Type `colors()` in your console to pull up all the named colors in R. Change at least one color in the penguin plot. \n3. Write \"Hello Penguins!\" on line 45, at least one blank line after the the end of the code chunk and your sentence. \n4.  Render this document and observe your changes.\n\n:::\n\nIn addition to rendering the complete document to view the results of code chunks, you can also run each code chunk interactively in the RStudio editor by clicking the play button icon in the top right corner of the code chunk, or keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER</kbd>. RStudio executes the code and displays the results either inline within your file or in the Console, depending on your preference.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Add some code\" icon=false}\n\n1.  Insert a new code chunk after your \"Hello Penguins!\" sentence. Make sure there is a blank line between your sentence and the code chunk\n2.  Type the code `2+2` in this code chunk and click the play button to execute it immediately.  \n3.  Render your document and observe your changes.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Markdown Text {#sec-markdown}\n\nMarkdown is a popular markup language that allows you to add formatting elements to text. Markdown is useful because it is lightweight, flexible, and platform independent. \n[See more basic syntax of Markdown at <a href=\"https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\"> https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html]{.aside}\n\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n| What you type     |  What you see |\n|:-----------------:|:-------------:|\n|  `**bold**`       |   **bold**    |\n|  `_italics_`      |  *italics*    |\n| ``` `code` ```    |    `code`     |\n| `$2\\beta - \\frac{\\mu}{n}$`  | $2\\beta - \\frac{\\mu}{n}$|\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n+-------------------+------------------+\n| What you type     | What you see     |\n+:=================:+:================:+\n| ```               |                  |\n| 1.  one           | 1.   one         |\n| 2.  two           | 2.   two         |\n| ```               |                  |\n+-------------------+------------------+\n| ```               |                  |\n| *  bullet         | * bullet         |\n| *  points         | * points         |\n| ```               |                  |\n+-------------------+------------------+\n:::\n::::::\n\nAdditionally, using `#` and `##` symbols at the start of a line creates first (`#`) and second (`##`) level headers (larger font size, bold, numbered), such as @sec-quarto-components and line 15 in the `hello.qmd` file where it says `## Meet Quarto` . Properly formatted headers are an important part of document organization and accessibility for screen reader navigation. \n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Add some formatting\" icon=false}\n\n1.  Add some formatting to your \"Hello Penguins!\" sentence. \n2.  Render your document and observe your changes.\n\n:::\n\n## Create professional looking PDF reports. \n\nTo convert your work into a professional looking PDF, or to write math symbols in your homework, or you need a typesetting program called $\\LaTeX$ (pronounced \"lay-tek\" or \"lah-tex\"). It's a super neat program, but also nearly 4Gb. Too big for our needs. That's where the `tinytex` package came from. we're going to use it to install a lightweight version of $\\LaTeX$. This will let us write math equations in Markdown/Quarto, and create nice PDF's of your work.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Your Turn\" icon=false}\n1. In the *console* type `tinytex::install_tinytex()` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This may take a few minutes to fully install. \n2. In the YAML header change `format: html` to `format: pdf`\n3. Render your document again. \n:::\n\n",
