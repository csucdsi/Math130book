We recognize there are many topics and many approaches to teach an introduction to the R programming language. We have picked specific topics and methods that we believe learners will need to succeed in subsequent classes.\n\n\n## R + IDE = Success\n\n-   The term **R** refers to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.\n\n- An **IDE** is an \"Integrated Development Environment\" and essentially is another program that lets you interact with R in a productive and efficient manner. \n\n- **[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)** has been a very popular IDE since around 2011 that has continued to flourish and improve throughtout the years. \n\n- **[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)** is a new IDE created by the developers of RStudio that is based off another popular IDE called VSCode - and aimed primarily at Data Scientists\n\n-   This book teaches you how to use R from within the **R Studio** IDE as we feel it is easier for new learners to start with.  You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in @sec-install\n\n-   ![Manual car gear shift representing coding in R](img/r-manual.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Manual car gear shift representing coding in R\" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"250\"} ![Automatic car gear shift representing RStudio environment](img/r-automatic.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Automatic car gear shift representing RStudio environment\" fig-align=\"right\" width=\"250\"}\n\n-   <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/D19rXKDUPYM\">Left photo credit</a>; <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Wec3M4dY_LE\">Right photo credit</a>.

Doesn't do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.\n-   Tons of learning resources\n-   Currently R is used in all of Chico's upper division Statistics & Data Science courses, as well as in some Science, Public Health, Economics, Finance, and some graduate courses.\n-   Does not involve lots of pointing and clicking (that's a good thing!)\n-   Works on data of all shapes and sizes\n-   Produces high-quality graphics\n-   Large and welcoming community\n\n### Why use R Studio?\n\n-   Customizable workspace that docks all windows together.\n-   Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)\n-   Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.\n-   Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.\n-   Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.\n-   Free training videos available from the developers directly.\n-   One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations, presentations (like this one!), websites.\n\n[Examples of things you can do in RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)\n\n## Programming can be scary!\n\n![Learning curve diagram by Allison Horst showing how much you think you know about R over time](img/r-learning-curve-horst.png){fig-alt=\"Line chart labeled 'How much I think I know about R' versus time, showing ups and downs with smiley faces at different stages.\" width=\"600\"}\n\n*Artwork by @allison_horst – used under CC BY 4.0.

[expect to learn this on your own](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)\n-   [A few](https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/28/laurence-bradford-10-reasons/) [other lists](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-benefits-of-learning-to-code/) [of reasons](https://skillcrush.com/2017/01/30/learn-to-code-benefits/)\n\n### Why no point and click?\n\nBecause it's not reproducible.\n\n-   Which boxes did you click last time?\n-   New data? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over.\n-   Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...\n\n\n\n## How this book is organized\n\n\n* videos\n* sections (intro/intermediate)\n* how to use with assignments in an LMS\n\n### Callout blocks and icons\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"General Information\"}\nBlue boxes contain notes and information for you to be aware of.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"You Try It!\"}\nGreen boxes contain \"you try it\" examples for you to try on your computer. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Danger\"}\nRed boxes contain warnings such as common errors or pitfalls. \n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Caution\"}\nnot sure if using yellow boxes \n:::\n\n\n\n-   🎦:associated video\n-   ✏️: You try it\n-   ❌: Don't do this thing\n\n### Code appearance\n\nIn these notes, code is displayed like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the output or result of the code is displayed with two pound signs\n(`##`)\n",
