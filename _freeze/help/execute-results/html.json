You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the\nissue might be.\n\nTry to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a\npackage is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand\nwhat you meant, but it can make things confusing for people trying to\nhelp you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.\n\n:warning: Don't let not knowing exactly how to describe your problem\nprevent you from asking. Screenshots help tremendously!\n\n**When asking someone for help try to** 1. Explain what thing you are\ntrying to do 2. Explain/show the code you wrote to try to do that thing\n3. Explain/show your result, and if it's not obvious explain why you\nfeel it's not the correct result. (E.g. you expected the answer to be 5,\nbut instead it's 10. )\n\n:warning: Don't spend more than 20 minutes banging your head on the wall\nbefore you ask for help!\n\n### Help from inside R Studio\n\n#### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions\n\nOne of the fastest ways to get help is to use the RStudio help\ninterface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand\npanel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word `mean`,\nRStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be\ninterested in. The description is then shown in the display window.\n\n#### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it\n\nIf you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you\ncan type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?barplot\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you\ncan use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nargs(lm)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...\n\nIf you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use\nthe `help.search()` function, which is called by the double question\nmark `??`. However, this only looks through the installed packages for\nhelp pages with a match to your search request\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n??kruskal\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the\n[rdocumentation.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that\nsearches through the help files across all packages available.\n\nFinally, a generic Google or internet search \"R \\<task\\>\" will often\neither send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful\nforum where someone else has already asked your question.\n\n#### I get an error message that I don't understand\n\nStart by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work\nvery well because often, package developers rely on the error catching\nprovided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be\nvery helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. \"subscript out of bounds\"). If\nthe message is very generic, you might also include the name of the\nfunction or package you're using in your query.\n\nIf you check Stack Overflow, search using the `[r]` tag. Most questions\nhave already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words\nin the search to find the answers:\n<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r>\n\n:warning: Development of R moves pretty fast. When at all possible, use\nresults from the past 1-2 years. Anything over 5 years old for packages\nsuch as `ggplot`, `dplyr`, and `forcats` are likely obsolete.\n\n### In Person help\n\n-   Start by ask the person sitting next to you! Don't hesitate to talk\n    to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help.\n-   Ask in the Math & Statistics [Discord\n    server](https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5) - we have a dedicated channel\n    just for this class but a lot of students in the server know how to\n    use R.\n-   Attend [Community\n    Coding](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml).\n    -   Drop in work session & dedicated space to work on coding\n        projects.\n    -   Collaborate with your peers and learn from experts.\n    -   Some hours are held over Zoom\n\n### Other Online\n\n-   In RStudio go to `Help` --\\> `Cheatsheets` or to this URL\n    https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/\n-   [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if\n    your question hasn't been answered before and is well crafted,\n    chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to\n    follow their guidelines on [how to ask a good\n    question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n-   [Chico R Users Google\n    Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug).\n-   The [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/): it is read by a lot\n    of people and is welcoming to new users.\n-   If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a\n    mailing list for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file\n    of the package that can be accessed using\n    \\`packageDescription(\"name-of-package:. You may also want to try to\n    email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the\n    code repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n### Using AI tools\n\n> write guidance here\n\n### Written\n\nIf you're a book kinda person, there is plenty of help available as\nwell. Many have online versions or free PDF's.\n\n-   R Markdown, the Definitive Guide:\n    https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/\n-   R for Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n-   Cookbook for R http://www.cookbook-r.com/\n-   R Graphics Cookbook (I use this all the time) -- Chapter 8 in the\n    above link\n-   The Art of R Programming https://nostarch.com/artofr.htm\n-   R for... http://r4stats.com/\n    -   Excel Users https://www.rforexcelusers.com/\n    -   SAS and SPSS Users http://r4stats.com/books/r4sas-spss/\n    -   STATA Users http://r4stats.com/books/r4stata/\n",
