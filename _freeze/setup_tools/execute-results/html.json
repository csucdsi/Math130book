All of the files within this folder can then be accessed using relative *paths*.\n\nThink of a *path* as driving directions to your instructors office in Holt Hall. It will be different for everyone if we start from your home. However, once you get onto campus, it's the same for everyone. \n\n* **Absolute paths** point to where a file is on a specific computer. \n    * Example: `/Users/rdonatello/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Teaching/MATH 130/data` This path to the `data` folder only exists on Dr. Donatello's macbook. \n* **Relative paths** indicate where inside the project folder a file is located. \n    * Example: `MATH 130/data`. This path to the `data` folder once you're already in the `MATH 130` folder.  \n\n\nAdditionally, working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without having to directly modify file paths in the individual scripts. This will be super important when we start importing data from an external file in @sec-import. \n\n\n### Naming Things\n\nYou also need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\n-   ALL CAPS (`MATH130`)\\\n-   no caps (`math130`)\n-   snake_case (`math_130`)\n-   CamelCase (`Math130`)\n\n### Create Folders\n\n1.  On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130`.\n2.  Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.\n    ![](img/folder_org.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Adding files into your class folder\n\nWhen you download a file, right click and \"Save as\" or \"Save target as\" and **actively choose** where to download this file.\n\n:x: Do not let files live in your downloads folder.\n\n:x: Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.\n\n:pencil2: Right click [\\[this link\\]](../hw/hw1.Rmd) to download and save Assignment 1 into your `homework` folder now.\n\n> need to fix hw1 link loc and qmd\n\n:cinema: [Windows video walk through.](https://youtu.be/ayar0LFRg0U)\n\n> to what?\n\n## Installing R and R Studio {#sec-install}\n\n\n**Download and install R and R Studio**\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Ipad, Tablet and Chromebook users</strong></summary>\n\nIf you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, you can use Posit Cloud for this class.\n\n-   Make a **Cloud FREE** account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free\n-   Start a new project by clicking on the button in the top right corner\n-   Then go to (#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio.\n\nThe free account allows for 25 project hours/month, which may not be enough for this class. If you run into time limits or you are using this for another class you will have to upgrade to the **Cloud Student** plan which is \\$5/month.\n\nUsing the cloud is easier to initially setup, but having your own installation on your computer ensures that\n\n-   you want to keep the program free forever\n-   you will be able to put your files under version control\n-   you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\n**Install R**  \n\n1.

It is\nalso where the results will be shown for commands that have been\nexecuted.\n\nYou can type commands directly into the console and press\n<kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten\nwhen you close the session.\n\n## Navigating R Studio\n\nWe will be interacting with the programming language R *only* through R Studio. Not by itself. There are four panes, or windows, in R Studio.\n\n![](img/rstudio-four-panes.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio using the default white theme showing four panes: Source, Console, Environment/History, and Files/Plots/Packages/Help.\" width=\"600\"}\n\n### Source {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/source-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Source pane showing a script file with Source on Save highlighted.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Source** pane (top-left) is where you write and edit your R scripts or Quarto documents.  \nIf you only see three panes and the **Console** is in the top-left, open a new script to make the Source pane appear:\n\n- **Mac:** Press Shift + Cmd + N  \n\n- **Windows:** Press Shift + Ctrl + N\n\n### Console {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/console-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Console pane showing startup message and command prompt (>) in the default white theme.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Console** pane (bottom-left) is where you type and run R commands.  \nThis is the actual R interpreter — it executes your code and displays the results immediately.  \n\n**R is an overgrown calculator**\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow try a more complicated equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in parse(text = input): <text>:1:21: unexpected ')'\n1: 2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)\n                        ^\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nUh oh, we got an Error. Nothing to worry about, errors happen all the\ntime.\n\n:pencil: Put a open parenthesis `(` before `log10` to fix it and try\nagain.\n\n **\\> R is waiting on you...**\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n``` r\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log(10\n```\n\nNotice the console shows a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't\nfinished entering a complete command.\n\nThis is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e.\nyou don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses,\nor the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.\n\nWhen this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command,\nclick inside the console window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the\nincomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.\n\n### Environment / History {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/environment-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Environment/History pane showing an empty environment and available tabs for Connections and Tutorial.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Environment / History** pane (top-right) shows all the objects you’ve created in your current R session — for example, data frames, variables, or plots you’ve assigned.\n\n- The **Environment** tab lists everything that currently exists in memory.  \n- The **History** tab keeps a record of all the commands you’ve run.\n\nThere are also some additional tabs in this area, like **Connections**, **Build**, **Tutorial**, and sometimes **Git**.  \nWe won’t cover those here, but RStudio has many additional tools and features available as you learn more.\n\n### Files / Plots / Packages / Help {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/files-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Files, Plots, Help, and Viewer pane highlighted in the default white theme.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Files / Plots / Packages / Help** pane (bottom-right) is used to explore files, view plots, manage packages, and read help pages.\n\n\n\n::: callout-caution {title = \"Navigating R Studio\"}\nWatch one of the following short videos to learn how to navigate R Studio.\n\n-   [R Girls on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vx4SPeNvols?si=1iSqsH1uNLFkB7yF&t=239)\n-   [Dr. D's overview](https://media.csuchico.edu/media/t/1_93i6jwy8)\n:::\n\n\n## Customizing\n\nSetting preferences in R Studio\n\nAKA: Retain sanity while troubleshooting\n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n![](img/rstudio_settings.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio General settings window showing 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' unchecked and 'Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never' selected.\" width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-6}\n1. Open **RStudio** and go to **Tools → Global Options…**  \n2. Uncheck **“Restore .RData into workspace at startup.”**  \n3. For **“Save workspace to .RData on exit:”** choose **Never.**  \n4. Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close the window.\n\nThis ensures that each time you restart R, you start with a clean environment instead of carrying forward objects from a previous session.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Packages\n\n[<a href=\"https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceballs:_The%E2%80%A6\">\"Where the real money from the movie is\nmade.\"</a>]{.aside}\n\nR is considered an **Open Source** software program. That means many\n(thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by\nwriting commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis\neasier, or to make a graphic prettier.\n\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will\nuse. However these other *user-written* packages add so much good stuff\nthat it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality\nthat makes R so powerful of a language.\n\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like\n`boxplot()` and `hist()` that exist in base R. But we will quickly move\non to creating graphics using functions contained in the `ggplot2`\npackage. We will be managing data using functions in `dplyr` and reading\nin Excel files using `readxl`. Installing packages will become your\nfavorite past-time.\n\n### Installing Packages\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"Install `ggplot2`\"}\nTyping the following in the console to install the `ggplot2` package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message\nsimilar to:\n\n```         \nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error\nmessage like the following:\n\n``` r\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)\n```\n\nThe correct package name is `ggplot2`, not `ggplot`.\n\n::: callout-caution {title = \"Alternative Method of installing Packages\"}\nAdditional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab. \n\n* On the packages tab, click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the name of the package you want in the text box. \n* At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to ‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.\n\n:::\n\n**Install all the things!**\n\n![](img/allthethings.jpg){fig-alt=\"Cartoon shouting 'Get all the things!' representing package installation excitement.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nNow that you're a package installing pro, go ahead and install the\nfollowing packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.\n\nInstall the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it\nto finish before entering the next command.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- `tidyverse`  \n- `sjPlot`\n- `quarto`\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- `openintro`  \n- `palmerpenguins`\n- `tinytex`\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"Trust but Verify\"}\nCheck to see if you have a package installed by looking in the packages tab.\nYou can also type the command `installed.packages()` into the console and examine the output.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Final Tips\n\n**Saving and closing your work.**\n\nUnless you're returning to work in R Studio in a short while, you should make a habit to save all open tabs and completely shut down R studio when you are done working. This ensures your environment is cleared.\n\n*This is a good thing.*\n\n**Restart R**\n\nTo restart R without shutting the entire window down, go to the file\nmenu bar in the top,\n\n> *Session* --\\> Restart R and Clear Output\n\nThis is good to do when switching between projects/classes.\n\nTo effectively restart R, go to the file menu and click *Session* , then \"Restart R\", or \"Restart R and clear output\". :cinema: [Link to video walk through](https://youtu.be/49u5xAYfrgk)\n\n",
