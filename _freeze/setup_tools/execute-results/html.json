For example keeping all files related to one class in it's own folder, separate from other classes. If you are taking another class using R at the same time as this one, it's even MORE important to keep your files separate. \n\n:::{.callout-important}\nTHIS SHOULD NOT BE YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER\n:::\n\n### Names are important\n\nChoose one of the four naming convention shown below for your class folder and stick with it. These are `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `kebab-case` or `UPPER_SNAKE`. \n\n![Common Naming Conventions](img/name_things.png){fig-alt=\"Cartoon representations of common cases in coding. A snake screams 'SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE' into the face of a camel (wearing ear muffs) with 'camelCase' written along its back. Vegetables on a skewer spell out 'kebab-case' (words on a skewer).

On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130` using your chosen naming convention.\n2.  Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.\n\n![](img/folder_org.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n### Be the boss of your files\n\nWhen you download a file, right click and \"Save as\" or \"Save target as\" and **actively choose** where to download this file.\n\n:::{.callout-important title = \"Avoid these pain points\"}\n\n* Do not left click on the links\n* Do not let files live in your downloads folder.\n* Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Your Turn\" icon=false}\nRight click [[this link]](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/_hello.qmd) to download and save this file into your `homework` folder. \n\nWe will use this file in the next lesson. \n:::\n\n\n\n## Installing R and R Studio {#sec-install}\n\nFollow the instructions appropriate for your operating system. \n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\" appearance=minimal title = \"Tablet / iPad / Chromebook\"}\nIf you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, you can use Posit Cloud for this class.\n\n-   Make a **Cloud FREE** account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free\n-   Start a new project by clicking on the button in the top right corner\n-   Then go to (#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio.\n\nThe free account allows for 25 project hours/month, which may not be enough for this class. If you run into time limits or you are using this for another class you will have to upgrade to the **Cloud Student** plan which is $5/month.\n\nUsing the cloud is easier to initially setup, but having your own installation on your computer ensures that\n\n-   you want to keep the program free forever\n-   you will be able to put your files under version control\n-   you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\" appearance=minimal title = \"Windows\"}\n\n**Install R**  \n\n1.  Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> and download the latest **R installer**.\n2.  Double-click the downloaded file and follow the prompts (default settings are fine).\n3.  When finished, you can delete the desktop shortcut that looks like a blue R. \n\n**Install RStudio**  \n\n1.  Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and download **RStudio Desktop (Free)** for Windows. \n2.  Double-click the installer and follow the prompts.\n3.  When installation finishes, open **RStudio** — it should detect R automatically.\n\n[Walk through video for Windows](https://youtu.be/KAeHFzxbHTA?si=xpeDGqt7gurg_rFR)\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\" appearance=minimal title = \"MacOS\"}\n\n**Install R** \n\n1.

There are rules and exceptions, and it can be extremely precise and sometimes frustrating in how literal it is. \n\n[Writing clear commands can be like explaining how to make a PB&J sandwich to a child.]{.aside}\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8>}}\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance=minimal}\nThis class does not assume that you have any knowledge in programming, and will provide all the codes that you need. \nFor best results you should be trying to understand this new language, and how to tell R to do what you want it to do. \n\nThe tendency may be to reach out to AI to help write code for you, but this does not help you _learn_ and worse can provide code that is overly complicated and does not work as intended.\n:::\n\n\n## Navigating R Studio\n\nWe will be interacting with the programming language R *only* through R Studio. Not by itself. Typically are four panes, or windows, in R Studio. When you first start the program, you may only see three. \n\n![The major windows (or panes) of the RStudio environment:](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/fig/rstudio_session_4pane_layout.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio using the default white theme showing four panes\"}\n\n[<a href = \"https://datacarpentry.github.io/genomics-r-intro/00-introduction.html#overview-and-customization-of-the-rstudio-layout\">Details pulled from the Data Carpentry Genomics lesson</a>]{.aside}\n\n#### Source {.unnumbered}\n\nThis pane is where you will write/view R and Quarto scripts. Some outputs (such as a dataset) will appear as a tab here.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Your Turn\" icon=false}\n_Click on **File --> New File --> R Script**_ to open an R script file.\n\n:::\n\n#### Console/Terminal/Jobs {.unnumbered}\n\nThe **console** is where you see the execution of commands.  \nYou can type commands directly into the console and press\n<kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.\n\n**R is an overgrown calculator**\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Your Turn\" icon=false}\nIn the console type the following code, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"👉 Your Turn\" icon=false}\nNow try a more complicated equation.

This means that you haven't finished entering a complete command.\n\nThis is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.\n\nWhen this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press <kbd>Esc</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.\n\n### Environment / History {.unnumbered}\n\nThe **Environment / History** pane (top-right) shows all the objects you’ve created in your current R session — for example, data frames, variables, or plots you’ve assigned.\n\n- The **Environment** tab lists everything that currently exists in memory.  \n- The **History** tab keeps a record of all the commands you’ve run.\n\nThere are also some additional tabs in this area, like **Connections**, **Build**, **Tutorial**, and sometimes **Git**.  We won’t cover those here, but RStudio has many additional tools and features available as you learn more.\n\n### Files / Plots / Packages / Help {.unnumbered}\n\nThe **Files / Plots / Packages / Help** pane is used to explore files, view plots, manage packages, and read help pages.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=false title = \"Navigating R Studio\"}\nOptional: Watch one of the following short videos to learn how to navigate R Studio.\n\n-   [R Girls on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vx4SPeNvols?si=1iSqsH1uNLFkB7yF&t=239)\n-   [Dr. D's overview](https://media.csuchico.edu/media/t/1_93i6jwy8)\n:::\n\n\n## Customizing\n\nSetting preferences in R Studio\n\nAKA: Retain sanity while troubleshooting\n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n![](img/rstudio_settings.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio General settings window showing 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' unchecked and 'Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never' selected.\" width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-6}\n1.

Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close the window.\n\nThis ensures that each time you restart R, you start with a clean environment instead of carrying forward objects from a previous session.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Packages\n\n[<a href=\"https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceballs:_The%E2%80%A6\">\"Where the real money from the movie is\nmade.\"</a>]{.aside}\n\nR is considered an **Open Source** software program. That means many\n(thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by\nwriting commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis\neasier, or to make a graphic prettier.\n\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will\nuse. However these other *user-written* packages add so much good stuff\nthat it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality\nthat makes R so powerful of a language.\n\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like\n`boxplot()` and `hist()` that exist in base R. But we will quickly move\non to creating graphics using functions contained in the `ggplot2`\npackage. We will be managing data using functions in `dplyr` and reading\nin Excel files using `readxl`. Installing packages will become your\nfavorite past-time.\n\n### Installing Packages\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"Install `ggplot2`\"}\nTyping the following in the console to install the `ggplot2` package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message\nsimilar to:\n\n```         \nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error\nmessage like the following:\n\n``` r\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)\n```\n\nThe correct package name is `ggplot2`, not `ggplot`.\n\n::: callout-caution {title = \"Alternative Method of installing Packages\"}\nAdditional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab. \n\n* On the packages tab, click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the name of the package you want in the text box. \n* At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to ‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.\n\n:::\n\n**Install all the things!**\n\n![](img/allthethings.jpg){fig-alt=\"Cartoon shouting 'Get all the things!' representing package installation excitement.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nNow that you're a package installing pro, go ahead and install the\nfollowing packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.\n\nInstall the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it\nto finish before entering the next command.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- `tidyverse`  \n- `sjPlot`\n- `quarto`\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- `openintro`  \n- `palmerpenguins`\n- `tinytex`\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title = \"Trust but Verify\"}\nCheck to see if you have a package installed by looking in the packages tab.\nYou can also type the command `installed.packages()` into the console and examine the output.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Final Tips\n\n**Saving and closing your work.**\n\nUnless you're returning to work in R Studio in a short while, you should make a habit to save all open tabs and completely shut down R studio when you are done working. This ensures your environment is cleared.\n\n*This is a good thing.*\n\n**Restart R**\n\nTo restart R without shutting the entire window down, go to the file\nmenu bar in the top,\n\n> *Session* --\\> Restart R and Clear Output\n\nThis is good to do when switching between projects/classes.\n\nTo effectively restart R, go to the file menu and click *Session* , then \"Restart R\", or \"Restart R and clear output\". :cinema: [Link to video walk through](https://youtu.be/49u5xAYfrgk)\n\n",
