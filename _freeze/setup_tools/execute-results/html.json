This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.\n\n### Naming Things\n\nYou also need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are:\n\n-   ALL CAPS (`MATH130`)\\\n-   no caps (`math130`)\n-   snake_case (`math_130`)\n-   CamelCase (`Math130`)\n\n### Create Folders\n\n1.  On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130`.\n2.  Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.\\\n    ![](img/folder_org.PNG){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"149\"}\n\n### Adding files into your class folder\n\nWhen you download a file, right click and \"Save as\" or \"Save target as\" and **actively choose** where to download this file.\n\n:x: Do not let files live in your downloads folder.\n\n:x: Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.\n\n:pencil2: Right click [\\[this link\\]](../hw/hw1.Rmd) to download and save Assignment 1 into your `homework` folder now.\n\n> need to fix hw1 link loc and qmd\n\n:cinema: [Windows video walk through.](https://youtu.be/ayar0LFRg0U)\n\n> to what?\n\n## Installing R and R Studio {#sec-install}\n\n\n**Download and install R and R Studio**\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Ipad, Tablet and Chromebook users</strong></summary>\n\nIf you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, you can use Posit Cloud for this class.\n\n-   Make a **Cloud FREE** account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free\n-   Start a new project by clicking on the button in the top right corner\n-   Then go to (#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio.\n\nThe free account allows for 25 project hours/month, which may not be enough for this class. If you run into time limits or you are using this for another class you will have to upgrade to the **Cloud Student** plan which is \\$5/month.\n\nUsing the cloud is easier to initially setup, but having your own installation on your computer ensures that\n\n-   you want to keep the program free forever\n-   you will be able to put your files under version control\n-   you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\n**Install R**  \n\n1.

It is\nalso where the results will be shown for commands that have been\nexecuted.\n\nYou can type commands directly into the console and press\n<kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten\nwhen you close the session.\n\n## Navigating R Studio\n\nWe will be interacting with the programming language R *only* through R Studio. Not by itself. There are four panes, or windows, in R Studio.\n\n![](img/rstudio-four-panes.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio using the default white theme showing four panes: Source, Console, Environment/History, and Files/Plots/Packages/Help.\" width=\"600\"}\n\n### Source {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/source-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Source pane showing a script file with Source on Save highlighted.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Source** pane (top-left) is where you write and edit your R scripts or Quarto documents.  \nIf you only see three panes and the **Console** is in the top-left, open a new script to make the Source pane appear:\n\n- **Mac:** Press Shift + Cmd + N  \n\n- **Windows:** Press Shift + Ctrl + N\n\n### Console {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/console-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Console pane showing startup message and command prompt (>) in the default white theme.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Console** pane (bottom-left) is where you type and run R commands.  \nThis is the actual R interpreter — it executes your code and displays the results immediately.  \n\n**R is an overgrown calculator**\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow try a more complicated equation.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in parse(text = input): <text>:1:21: unexpected ')'\n1: 2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)\n                        ^\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUh oh, we got an Error. Nothing to worry about, errors happen all the\ntime.\n\n:pencil: Put a open parenthesis `(` before `log10` to fix it and try\nagain.\n\n **\\> R is waiting on you...**\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n``` r\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log(10\n```\n\nNotice the console shows a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't\nfinished entering a complete command.\n\nThis is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e.\nyou don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses,\nor the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.\n\nWhen this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command,\nclick inside the console window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the\nincomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.\n\n### Environment / History {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/environment-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Environment/History pane showing an empty environment and available tabs for Connections and Tutorial.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Environment / History** pane (top-right) shows all the objects you’ve created in your current R session — for example, data frames, variables, or plots you’ve assigned.\n\n- The **Environment** tab lists everything that currently exists in memory.  \n- The **History** tab keeps a record of all the commands you’ve run.\n\nThere are also some additional tabs in this area, like **Connections**, **Build**, **Tutorial**, and sometimes **Git**.  \nWe won’t cover those here, but RStudio has many additional tools and features available as you learn more.\n\n### Files / Plots / Packages / Help {.unnumbered}\n\n![](img/files-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Files, Plots, Help, and Viewer pane highlighted in the default white theme.\" width=\"600\"}\n\nThe **Files / Plots / Packages / Help** pane (bottom-right) is used to explore files, view plots, manage packages, and read help pages.\n\n\n\n::: callout-caution\n### yellow for videos?\n\n🎦 Watch one of the following short videos to learn how to navigate R Studio.\n\n-   [R Girls on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vx4SPeNvols?si=1iSqsH1uNLFkB7yF&t=239)\n-   [Dr. D's overview](https://media.csuchico.edu/media/t/1_93i6jwy8)\n:::\n\n\n## Customizing\n\nSetting preferences in R Studio\n\nAKA: Retain sanity while troubleshooting\n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n![](img/rstudio_settings.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio General settings window showing 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' unchecked and 'Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never' selected.\" width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-6}\n1. Open **RStudio** and go to **Tools → Global Options…**  \n2. Uncheck **“Restore .RData into workspace at startup.”**  \n3. For **“Save workspace to .RData on exit:”** choose **Never.**  \n4. Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close the window.\n\nThis ensures that each time you restart R, you start with a clean environment instead of carrying forward objects from a previous session.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Packages**\n\n[*\"Where the real money from the movie is\nmade.*\"](https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceballs:_The%E2%80%A6){.aside}\n\nR is considered an **Open Source** software program. That means many\n(thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by\nwriting commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis\neasier, or to make a graphic prettier.\n\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will\nuse. However these other *user-written* packages add so much good stuff\nthat it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality\nthat makes R so powerful of a language.\n\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like\n`boxplot()` and `hist()` that exist in base R. But we will quickly move\non to creating graphics using functions contained in the `ggplot2`\npackage. We will be managing data using functions in `dplyr` and reading\nin Excel files using `readxl`. Installing packages will become your\nfavorite past-time.\n\n**Installing Packages**\n\n:pencil: Start by typing the following in the console to install the\n`ggplot2` package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message\nsimliar to:\n\n```         \nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error\nmessage like the following:\n\n``` r\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)\n```\n\nThe correct package name is `ggplot2`, not `ggplot`.\n\n::: callout-caution\n**Alternative Method of installing Packages:**\\\nUse the Package tab in the lower right pane in R Studio.\n:::\n\n**Install all the things!**\n\n![](img/allthethings.jpg){fig-alt=\"Cartoon shouting 'Get all the things!' representing package installation excitement.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nNow that you're a package installing pro, go ahead and install the\nfollowing packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.\n\nInstall the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it\nto finish before entering the next command.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n\n- `tidyverse`  \n- `sjPlot`\n- `quarto`\n\n</td><td>\n\n- `openintro`  \n- `palmerpenguins`\n- `tinytex`\n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n## Final Tips\n\n**Saving and closing your work.**\n\nUnless you're returning to work in R Studio in a short while, you should make a habit to save all open tabs and completely shut down R studio when you are done working. This ensures your environment is cleared.\n\n*This is a good thing.*\n\n**Restart R**\n\nTo restart R without shutting the entire window down, go to the file\nmenu bar in the top,\n\n> *Session* --\\> Restart R and Clear Output\n\nThis is good to do when switching between projects/classes.\n\nTo effectively restart R, go to the file menu and click *Session* , then \"Restart R\", or \"Restart R and clear output\". :cinema: [Link to video walk through](https://youtu.be/49u5xAYfrgk)\n\n",
