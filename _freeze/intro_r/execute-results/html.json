It is\nalso where the results will be shown for commands that have been\nexecuted.\n\nYou can type commands directly into the console and press\n<kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten\nwhen you close the session.\n\n## Code appearance\n\nIn these notes, code is displayed like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhere the output or result of the code is displayed with two pound signs\n(`##`)\n\n## R is an overgrown calculator\n\n> can I use webR for this page?\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow try a more complicated equation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUh oh, we got an Error. Nothing to worry about, errors happen all the\ntime.\n\n:pencil: Put a open parenthesis `(` before `log10` to fix it and try\nagain.\n\n# \\> R is waiting on you...\n\n:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.\n\n``` r\n2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log(10\n```\n\nNotice the console shows a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't\nfinished entering a complete command.\n\nThis is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e.\nyou don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses,\nor the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.\n\nWhen this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command,\nclick inside the console window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the\nincomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.\n\n## Packages\n\n[*\"Where the real money from the movie is\nmade.*\"](https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceballs:_The%E2%80%A6){.aside}\n\nR is considered an **Open Source** software program. That means many\n(thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by\nwriting commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis\neasier, or to make a graphic prettier.\n\nWhen you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will\nuse. However these other *user-written* packages add so much good stuff\nthat it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality\nthat makes R so powerful of a language.\n\nFor example we will be creating graphics using functions like\n`boxplot()` and `hist()` that exist in base R. But we will quickly move\non to creating graphics using functions contained in the `ggplot2`\npackage. We will be managing data using functions in `dplyr` and reading\nin Excel files using `readxl`. Installing packages will become your\nfavorite past-time.\n\n## Installing Packages\n\n:pencil: Start by typing the following in the console to install the\n`ggplot2` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen the download and install is complete, you should see a message\nsimliar to:\n\n```         \nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\Robin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpi8NAym\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error\nmessage like the following:\n\n``` r\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)\n```\n\nThe correct package name is `ggplot2`, not `ggplot`.\n\n::: callout-caution\n**Alternative Method of installing Packages:**\\\nUse the Package tab in the lower right pane in R Studio.\n:::\n\n## Install all the things!\n\nNow that you're a package installing pro, go ahead and install the\nfollowing packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.\n\n> set as two columns\n\nInstall the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it\nto finish before entering the next command.\n\n-   `tidyverse`\n-   `rmarkdown`\n-   `openintro`\n-   `tinytex`\n\n## Download and Install TinyTex\n\nTo convert your work into a professional looking PDF, or to write math\nsymbols in your homework, or you need a typesetting program called\n$\\LaTeX$ (pronounced \"lay-tek\" or \"lah-tex\"). It's a super neat program,\nbut also nearly 4Gb. Too big for our needs. That's where the `tinytex`\npackage came from. we're going to use it to install a lightweight\nversion of $\\LaTeX$. This will let us write math equations in R\nMarkdown, and create PDF's of your homework.\n\nIn your console type the following and hit **Enter**\n\n```         \ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n\nThis may take a few minutes, but then you're good to go!\n\n## Seeking Help\n\n> help me help you\n\n*Sometimes a second pair of eyeballs is all you need*\n\n![Image credit: Intro to DS using R\nWorkshop](https://bcgov.github.io/ds-cop-intro-to-r/seeking-help-fr%20om-others-with-reprex.html)\\](img/debugging.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"\nwidth=\"149\"}\n\n*Much of this information is also on the [FAQ](../faq.html) page*\n\n> still accurate?\n\n## Advice on asking for help\n\nThe key to receiving help from someone is for them to rapidly grasp your\nproblem. You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the\nissue might be.\n\nTry to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a\npackage is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand\nwhat you meant, but it can make things confusing for people trying to\nhelp you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.\n\n:warning: Don't let not knowing exactly how to describe your problem\nprevent you from asking. Screenshots help tremendously!\n\n**When asking someone for help try to** 1. Explain what thing you are\ntrying to do 2. Explain/show the code you wrote to try to do that thing\n3. Explain/show your result, and if it's not obvious explain why you\nfeel it's not the correct result. (E.g. you expected the answer to be 5,\nbut instead it's 10. )\n\n:warning: Don't spend more than 20 minutes banging your head on the wall\nbefore you ask for help!\n\n## Help from inside R Studio\n\n### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions\n\nOne of the fastest ways to get help is to use the RStudio help\ninterface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand\npanel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word `mean`,\nRStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be\ninterested in. The description is then shown in the display window.\n\n### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it\n\nIf you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you\ncan type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?barplot\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you\ncan use:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nargs(lm)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...\n\nIf you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use\nthe `help.search()` function, which is called by the double question\nmark `??`. However, this only looks through the installed packages for\nhelp pages with a match to your search request\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n??kruskal\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the\n[rdocumentation.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that\nsearches through the help files across all packages available.\n\nFinally, a generic Google or internet search \"R \\<task\\>\" will often\neither send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful\nforum where someone else has already asked your question.\n\n### I get an error message that I don't understand\n\nStart by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work\nvery well because often, package developers rely on the error catching\nprovided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be\nvery helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. \"subscript out of bounds\"). If\nthe message is very generic, you might also include the name of the\nfunction or package you're using in your query.\n\nIf you check Stack Overflow, search using the `[r]` tag. Most questions\nhave already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words\nin the search to find the answers:\n<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r>\n\n:warning: Development of R moves pretty fast. When at all possible, use\nresults from the past 1-2 years. Anything over 5 years old for packages\nsuch as `ggplot`, `dplyr`, and `forcats` are likely obsolete.\n\n## In Person help\n\n-   Start by ask the person sitting next to you! Don't hesitate to talk\n    to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help.\n-   Ask in the Math & Statistics [Discord\n    server](https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5) - we have a dedicated channel\n    just for this class but a lot of students in the server know how to\n    use R.\n-   Attend [Community\n    Coding](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml).\n    -   Drop in work session & dedicated space to work on coding\n        projects.\n    -   Collaborate with your peers and learn from experts.\n    -   Some hours are held over Zoom\n\n## Other Online\n\n-   In RStudio go to `Help` --\\> `Cheatsheets` or to this URL\n    https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/\n-   [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if\n    your question hasn't been answered before and is well crafted,\n    chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to\n    follow their guidelines on [how to ask a good\n    question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n-   [Chico R Users Google\n    Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug).\n-   The [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/): it is read by a lot\n    of people and is welcoming to new users.\n-   If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a\n    mailing list for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file\n    of the package that can be accessed using\n    \\`packageDescription(\"name-of-package:. You may also want to try to\n    email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the\n    code repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n## Using AI tools\n\n> write guidance here\n\n## Written\n\nIf you're a book kinda person, there is plenty of help available as\nwell.
