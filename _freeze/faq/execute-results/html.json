You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.\n\nTry to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant, but it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as possible when describing your problem.\n\n:warning: Don't let not knowing exactly how to describe your problem prevent you from asking. Screenshots help tremendously!\n\n**When asking someone for help try to**\n1. Explain what thing you are trying to do\n2. Explain/show the code you wrote to try to do that thing\n3. Explain/show your result, and if it's not obvious explain why you feel it's not the correct result. (E.g. you expected the answer to be 5, but instead it's 10. )\n\n:warning: Don't spend more than 20 minutes banging your head on the wall before you ask for help!\n\n\n## Help from inside R Studio\n\n### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions\n\nOne of the fastest ways to get help is to use the RStudio help interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word `mean`, RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.\n\n### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it\n\nIf you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?barplot\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nargs(lm)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...\n\nIf you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the\n`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.\nHowever, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a\nmatch to your search request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n??kruskal\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't find what you are looking for, you can use\nthe [rdocumentation.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches\nthrough the help files across all packages available.\n\nFinally, a generic Google or internet search \"R \\<task\\>\" will often either send\nyou to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone\nelse has already asked your question.\n\n### I get an error message that I don't understand\n\nStart by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. \"subscript out of bounds\"). If the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the function or package you're using in your query.\n\nIf you check Stack Overflow, search using the `[r]` tag. Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in the search to find the answers: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)\n\n:warning: Development of R moves pretty fast. When at all possible, use results from the past 1-2 years. Anything over 5 years old for packages such as `ggplot`, `dplyr`, and `forcats` are likely obsolete. \n\n\n\n### From a real live person\n\n* Start by ask the person sitting next to you! Don't hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help.\n* Ask in the Math & Statistics [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5) - we have a dedicated channel just for this class but a lot of students in the server know how to use R. \n* Attend [Community Coding](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml). \n  - Drop in work session & dedicated space to work on coding projects.\n  - Collaborate with your peers and learn from experts.\n  - Some hours are held over Zoom\n\n\n\n<!-- updateme -->\n\nFor Spring 2025 help is available both in person and online. \n\n<!-- * The person sitting next to you.

This will let you see and access the class channels.\n  - See [Syllabus: Student Support](syllabus.html) for details\n\n\n## Other Online\n\n* In RStudio go to `Help` --> `Cheatsheets` or to this URL https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/\n* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if your question\n  hasn't been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an\n  answer in less than 5 min.

Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can\n  be accessed using `packageDescription(\"name-of-package:. You may also want\n  to try to email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the\n  code repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n\n## Online from people\n\n* In RStudio go to `Help` --> `Cheatsheets`   \n* R Studio Cloud interactive lessons: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers\n* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if your question\n  hasn't been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an\n  answer in less than 5 min.
