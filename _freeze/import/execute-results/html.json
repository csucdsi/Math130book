Do not leave these files in your downloads folder. \n\n* [NCBirths](https://www.norcalbiostat.com/data/NCbirths.csv)\n* [email](https://www.norcalbiostat.com/data/email.txt)\n* [Police Shootings](https://www.norcalbiostat.com/data/fatal-police-shootings-data.xlsx)\n:::\n\n## File types <a href=\"https://media.csuchico.edu/media/MATH+130+-+Lecture+09A+File+Types/1_9p0tuqjq\" target=\"_blank\">(Video)</a>\n\nIn this lesson we are only going to explore reading files that exist on your computer into R from three most commonly used data sources: A tab-delimited text file, A CSV file and an Excel file. \nThe three different files we will be using have different file types, or extensions.  \n\n* `email.txt` is a `.txt` or \"text\" file.\n* `NCBirths.csv` is a `.csv` or \"comma separated values\" file.\n* `fatal-police-shootings-data.xlsx` is a `.xlsx` or Excel file. \n\nEach of these file types differ in the type of _delimiter_ used. The _delimiter_ is a character or symbol that separates columns of data from each other when stored in an external file.  Recall back to the earlier lesson on data frames and matrices. Each column in the matrix represented data on a specific variable. Something had to tell R how to distinguish which values went with which variable. \n\nThere are two main types of delimiters we will consider in this class; comma and tab. That does not mean that data can't be stored in other ways, these are just the two most common. \n\nEach of these different data types requires a different function or mechanism to import the data into R. If you use the wrong mechanism, the data may not be read in correctly if at all. \n\n## General Importing data  <a href=\"https://media.csuchico.edu/media/MATH+130+-+Lecture+09A+General+Importing+Data/1_o1ggmj66\" target=\"_blank\">(Video)</a>\n\nTo import data into R, we have to tell the program explicitly where to find the files you just downloaded. To do that we need to find the file's _path_. The _path_ is a programmatic way to direct your computer to the location of a file. It's like the file's address, or, where it lives on your computer. \n<!-- ([link](\"../static/img/path.png\") to picture to explain absolute vs relative path if there is time) -->\n\nIn all the examples below, the path shown (`data/`) is the path on **MY** computer. You will have to update this path to **YOUR** path on **YOUR** machine that points to your MATH130 folder. \n\nYou can find the path of a file by navigating to the desired file in your finder or browser window. Right click and copy the file to the clipboard, then right click and pasting into a R markdown file. This will show a path that looks something like this: \n\n```r\nfile:///C:/Math 130/Data/Challenger.txt\n```\n\nYou will need to remove the `file:///` part at the beginning before using this path. You will have three chances in this lab to practice this. \n\n\n### Special Instructions for Mac\n\n* Navigate to the file or folder you wish to copy the path for Right-click (or Control+Click, or a Two-Finger click on trackpads) on the file or folder in the Mac Finder\n* While in the right-click menu, hold down the OPTION key to reveal the “Copy (item name) as Pathname” option, which replaces the standard Copy option. Once selected, the file or folders path is now in the clipboard, ready to be pasted anywhere\n\n*Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52695546/how-to-copy-path-of-a-file-in-mac-os*\n\n## Checking the import was successful\n\nThe first thing you should always do after importing a data file is look at the raw data and ask yourself the following things: \n\n1. Were the variable names read in correctly? \n2. Is there the expected number of rows and columns? \n3. Are the data types for each variable as expected? \n\nThere are many ways this can be done. Here are three:\n\n1. `str()` to show you the structure of the data frame. \n2. `head()` to show you the top 6 rows\n3. `data[1:x, 1:x]` - when the data frame is too large for the above two to work well, we can use matrix notation to view only the first X columns, and first X rows. \n\nNext we will read in three different data sets, each with unique file types, and look at each one to make sure it was read in correctly. \n\n## Text files\nText files are very simple files that have a `.txt` file extension. Common delimiters include a space, a comma (,) or a tab. Uncommon delimiters could include a % or even a semi-colon. By opening the file directly on your computer (not in R) you can see what delimiter is being used. \n\nWe will use the `read.table()` function that is in base R to read in any type of delimited file. A tab-delimited text file can be read in using `\"\\t\"` as the deliminator character. In this class you **ALWAYS** want to include `header=TRUE` to signify that the data in the first row contains our column names. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nemail <- read.table(\"data/email.txt\", header=TRUE, sep=\"\\t\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we call the `str()` or _structure_ function to examine the data that was imported. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(email)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t3921 obs. of  21 variables:\n $ spam        : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ to_multiple : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ...\n $ from        : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ cc          : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ sent_email  : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ...\n $ time        : chr  \"2011-12-31 22:16:41\" \"2011-12-31 23:03:59\" \"2012-01-01 08:00:32\" \"2012-01-01 01:09:49\" ...\n $ image       : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ attach      : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ dollar      : int  0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ winner      : chr  \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" ...\n $ inherit     : int  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ viagra      : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ password    : int  0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ num_char    : num  11.37 10.5 7.77 13.26 1.23 ...\n $ line_breaks : int  202 202 192 255 29 25 193 237 69 68 ...\n $ format      : int  1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ re_subj     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ exclaim_subj: int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ urgent_subj : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ exclaim_mess: int  0 1 6 48 1 1 1 18 1 0 ...\n $ number      : chr  \"big\" \"small\" \"small\" \"small\" ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The `email` data set has 3921 observations, and 21 variables. \n* The variable names were read in correctly, as evidenced by the words in the far right corner after the `$`. \n* Most variables are treated as numeric integers, except a few are factors.
