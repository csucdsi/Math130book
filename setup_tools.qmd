## Setup your class folder for success! :cinema:

> link to chapter video? 

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. 

### Naming Things

You also need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (`MATH130`)  
* no caps (`math130`)
* snake_case (`math_130`) 
* CamelCase (`Math130`) 


### Create Folders

1. On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130`. 
2. Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.

### Adding files into your class folder

When you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

:x: Do not let files live in your downloads folder. 

:x: Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.


:pencil2: Right click [[this link]](../hw/hw1.Rmd) to download and save Assignment 1 into your `homework` folder now.

## Installing R and R Studio

::: callout-danger
### Tablet and Chromebook users

If you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, you can use Posit Cloud for this class.

-   Make a **Cloud FREE** account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free
-   Start a new project by clicking on the button in the top right corner
-   Then go to [slide #6](#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio.

The free account allows for 25 project hours/month, which may not be enough for this class. If you run into time limits or you are using this for another class you will have to upgrade to the **Cloud Student** plan which is \$5/month.
:::

Using the cloud is easier to initially setup, but having your own installation on your computer ensures that

-   you want to keep the program free forever
-   you will be able to put your files under version control
-   you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet

## Download and install R

![](img/R.png){fig-align="center" width="149"}

### Step 1: Download R v 4.5+

-   Windows 10 https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

    -   First link under "Latest Release" and looks like **R-4.5.0.pkg**.
    -   :warning: You may later get a message about needing *X11* or *XQuartz*. The download for that program is also on this page. (Mac only)
-   Choose to save the file, do not open or run.

### Step 2: Install R

## Navigating R Studio

We will be interacting with the programming language R *only* through R Studio. Not by itself. There are four panes, or windows, in R Studio.

### Setting preferences in R Studio

AKA: Retain sanity while troubleshooting 

> side by side/text image

1. Open R Studio and go to the file menu go to _Tools_ then _Global Options_.
2. Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" 
3. Where it says "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" Select "Never""
4. Click apply then ok to close that window.
  
This will ensure that when you restart R you do not "carry forward" objects such as data sets that you were working on in a prior assignment. 

To effectively restart R, go to the file menu and click _Session_ , then "Restart R", or "Restart R and clear output".
