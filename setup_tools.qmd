## Setup your class folder for success! :cinema:

> link to chapter video?

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.

### Naming Things

You also need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are:

-   ALL CAPS (`MATH130`)\
-   no caps (`math130`)
-   snake_case (`math_130`)
-   CamelCase (`Math130`)

### Create Folders

1.  On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130`.
2.  Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.\

### Adding files into your class folder

When you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

:x: Do not let files live in your downloads folder.

:x: Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.

:pencil2: Right click [\[this link\]](../hw/hw1.Rmd) to download and save Assignment 1 into your `homework` folder now.

## Installing R and R Studio

**Download and install R and R Studio**

<details>

<summary><strong>Ipad, Tablet and Chromebook users</strong></summary>

If you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, you can use Posit Cloud for this class.

-   Make a **Cloud FREE** account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free
-   Start a new project by clicking on the button in the top right corner
-   Then go to (#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio.

The free account allows for 25 project hours/month, which may not be enough for this class. If you run into time limits or you are using this for another class you will have to upgrade to the **Cloud Student** plan which is \$5/month.

Using the cloud is easier to initially setup, but having your own installation on your computer ensures that

-   you want to keep the program free forever
-   you will be able to put your files under version control
-   you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet

## Terminology

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the
computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those
instructions.

We write, or *code*, instructions in R because it is a common language
that both the computer and we can understand.

We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the computer to follow
the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those commands.

The **console** pane is the place where commands written in the R
language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is
also where the results will be shown for commands that have been
executed.

You can type commands directly into the console and press
<kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten
when you close the session.

## Navigating R Studio

We will be interacting with the programming language R *only* through R Studio. Not by itself. There are four panes, or windows, in R Studio.

![](img/rstudio-four-panes.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of RStudio using the default white theme showing four panes: Source, Console, Environment/History, and Files/Plots/Packages/Help." width="600"}

### Source {.unnumbered}

![](img/source-pane.png){fig-alt="RStudio Source pane showing a script file with Source on Save highlighted." width="600"}

The **Source** pane (top-left) is where you write and edit your R scripts or Quarto documents.  
If you only see three panes and the **Console** is in the top-left, open a new script to make the Source pane appear:

- **Mac:** Press Shift + Cmd + N  

- **Windows:** Press Shift + Ctrl + N

### Console {.unnumbered}

![](img/console-pane.png){fig-alt="RStudio Console pane showing startup message and command prompt (>) in the default white theme." width="600"}

The **Console** pane (bottom-left) is where you type and run R commands.  
This is the actual R interpreter — it executes your code and displays the results immediately.  

**R is an overgrown calculator**

:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
2+2
```

Now try a more complicated equation.

```{r}
#| error: true
2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)
```

Uh oh, we got an Error. Nothing to worry about, errors happen all the
time.

:pencil: Put a open parenthesis `(` before `log10` to fix it and try
again.

 **\> R is waiting on you...**

:pencil: In the console type the following code, then press `Enter`.

``` r
2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log(10
```

Notice the console shows a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't
finished entering a complete command.

This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e.
you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses,
or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.

When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command,
click inside the console window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the
incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.

### Environment / History {.unnumbered}

![](img/environment-pane.png){fig-alt="RStudio Environment/History pane showing an empty environment and available tabs for Connections and Tutorial." width="600"}

The **Environment / History** pane (top-right) shows all the objects you’ve created in your current R session — for example, data frames, variables, or plots you’ve assigned.

- The **Environment** tab lists everything that currently exists in memory.  
- The **History** tab keeps a record of all the commands you’ve run.

There are also some additional tabs in this area, like **Connections**, **Build**, **Tutorial**, and sometimes **Git**.  
We won’t cover those here, but RStudio has many additional tools and features available as you learn more.

### Files / Plots / Packages / Help {.unnumbered}

![](img/files-pane.png){fig-alt="RStudio Files, Plots, Help, and Viewer pane highlighted in the default white theme." width="600"}

The **Files / Plots / Packages / Help** pane (bottom-right) is used to explore files, view plots, manage packages, and read help pages.

## Customizing

Setting preferences in R Studio

AKA: Retain sanity while troubleshooting

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
![](img/rstudio_settings.png){fig-alt="RStudio General settings window showing 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup' unchecked and 'Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never' selected." width="100%"}
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
1. Open **RStudio** and go to **Tools → Global Options…**  
2. Uncheck **“Restore .RData into workspace at startup.”**  
3. For **“Save workspace to .RData on exit:”** choose **Never.**  
4. Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close the window.

This ensures that each time you restart R, you start with a clean environment instead of carrying forward objects from a previous session.

**Packages**

[*"Where the real money from the movie is
made.*"](https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceballs:_The%E2%80%A6){.aside}

R is considered an **Open Source** software program. That means many
(thousands) of people contribute to the software. They do this by
writing commands (called functions) to make a particular analysis
easier, or to make a graphic prettier.

When you download R, you get access to a lot of functions that we will
use. However these other *user-written* packages add so much good stuff
that it really is the backbone of the customizability and functionality
that makes R so powerful of a language.

For example we will be creating graphics using functions like
`boxplot()` and `hist()` that exist in base R. But we will quickly move
on to creating graphics using functions contained in the `ggplot2`
package. We will be managing data using functions in `dplyr` and reading
in Excel files using `readxl`. Installing packages will become your
favorite past-time.

**Installing Packages**

:pencil: Start by typing the following in the console to install the
`ggplot2` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

When the download and install is complete, you should see a message
simliar to:

```         
The downloaded binary packages are in
    C:\Users\Robin\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmpi8NAym\downloaded_packages
```

:warning: R is case sensitive and spelling matters. If you get an error
message like the following:

``` r
Warning in install.packages :
  package ‘ggplot’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)
```

The correct package name is `ggplot2`, not `ggplot`.

::: callout-caution
**Alternative Method of installing Packages:**\
Use the Package tab in the lower right pane in R Studio.
:::

**Install all the things!**

![](img/allthethings.jpg){fig-alt="Cartoon shouting 'Get all the things!' representing package installation excitement." width="500"}

Now that you're a package installing pro, go ahead and install the
following packages that we will be using in the next few weeks.

Install the list of packages to the left one at a time and wait for it
to finish before entering the next command.

<table>
<tr><td>

- `tidyverse`  
- `sjPlot`
- `quarto`

</td><td>

- `openintro`  
- `palmerpenguins`
- `tinytex`

</td></tr>
</table>



## Final Tips

**Saving and closing your work.**

Unless you're returning to work in R Studio in a short while, you should
make a habit to save all open tabs and completely shut down R studio
when you are done working. This ensures your environment is cleared.
*This is a good thing.*

**Restart R**

To restart R without shutting the entire window down, go to the file
menu bar in the top,

> *Session* --\> Restart R and Clear Output

This is good to do when switching between projects/classes.

To effectively restart R, go to the file menu and click *Session* , then "Restart R", or "Restart R and clear output". :cinema: [Link to video walk through](https://youtu.be/49u5xAYfrgk)
