# Course Overview {.unnumbered}

## Program Terminology

-   The term **R** refers to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.
- An **IDE** is an "Integrated Development Environment" and essentially is another program that lets you interact with R in a productive and efficient manner. 
    - **[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)** has been a very popular IDE since around 2011 that has continued to flourish and improve throughtout the years. 
    - **[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)** is a new IDE created by the developers of RStudio that is based off another popular IDE called VSCode - and aimed primarily at Data Scientists

[RStudio extends what R can do, and makes it easier to write R code and interact with R. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/D19rXKDUPYM">Left photo credit</a>; <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Wec3M4dY_LE">Right photo credit</a>.]{.aside}

This book teaches you how to use R from within the **R Studio** IDE as we feel it is easier for new learners to start with.  You will have to install both onto your computer. Setup instructions are discussed later in @sec-install


## Motivation

### Why use R?

-   Open source, cross-platform, and free
-   Great for reproducibility
-   Flexible and extensible. Doesn't do something you want? Create a custom function for yourself.
-   Tons of learning resources
-   Currently R is used in many upper division & graduate level Statistics and Research methods courses in domains such as Public Health, Economics, Finance, and Political Science.
-   Does not involve lots of pointing and clicking (that's a good thing!)
-   Works on data of all shapes and sizes
-   Produces high-quality graphics
-   Large and welcoming community

### Why use R Studio?

-   Customizable workspace that docks all windows together.
-   Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, Stan)
-   Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses.
-   Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.
-   Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available.
-   Free training videos available from the developers directly.
-   One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, dashboards, presentations (like this one!), websites.

## Programming can be scary!
It's important to acknowledge that computer programming is a new skill, that may bring a roller coaster of emotions with it while you learn.

Learning to program has lots of benefits

-   Improves your logical skills and critical problem solving
-   Increases your attention to detail
-   Increases your self reliance and empowers you to control your own research.
-   Your PI will love your awesome graphics and reports.
-   Some people think what you do is magic.
-   Thinking graduate school? [expect to learn this on your own](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)
-   [A few](https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/28/laurence-bradford-10-reasons/) [other lists](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-benefits-of-learning-to-code/) [of reasons](https://skillcrush.com/2017/01/30/learn-to-code-benefits/)

### Why no point and click?

Because it's not reproducible.

-   Which boxes did you click last time?
-   New data? Gotta do it all over.
-   Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over.
-   Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...

### Follow along videos
Sections that have associated videos will be denoted with a 🎦. 
### Code appearance

In these notes, code is displayed like this:

```{r}
2+2
```

where the output or result of the code is displayed directly after.
